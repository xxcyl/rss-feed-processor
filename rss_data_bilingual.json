Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Children diagnosed with hearing loss typically demonstrate increased rates of vestibular loss as compared with their peers, with hearing within normal limits. Decreased vestibular function is linked with delays in gross motor development, acquisition of gross motor skills, and academic challenges. Timely development of sitting and walking gross motor skills aids in the progress of environmental exploratory activities, which have been tied to cognitive, language, and vocabulary development. Considering the time-sensitive development of gross motor skills and cognitive, language, and vocabulary development, identifying vestibular loss in infancy can support early intervention. This scoping review analyzes stimulus, recording, and participant factors relevant to assessing cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) in the infant population.\nDESIGN: The scoping literature review was conducted on literature published between 2000 and 2023, focusing on articles assessing cVEMPs in infants. Two authors independently followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis guidelines for title and abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessments. Sixteen articles meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis.\nRESULTS: The existing literature lacks consensus regarding stimulus and recording parameters for measuring infant cVEMPs. In addition, the review reveals a decrease in cVEMP response occurrence rates with the severity of hearing loss, especially in cases of severe to profound hearing loss, compared with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in infants.\nCONCLUSIONS: This scoping review demonstrates the increasing use of cVEMP as a reliable tool for objectively assessing infant vestibular function. The lack of consensus in stimulus and recording parameters emphasizes the need for systematic research to establish an evidence-based protocol for cVEMP measurements in infants. Such a protocol will ensure the reliable measurement of cVEMPs in infants and enhance the effectiveness of cVEMP as part of the infant vestibular test battery. In addition, there is a necessity for a comprehensive large-scale study to evaluate the practicality and feasibility of implementing vestibular screening protocols for infants diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in the United States.\nPMID:\n39099011\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001548",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have a higher incidence of hearing loss (HL) compared with their peers without developmental disabilities. Little is known about the associations between HL and functional hearing for individuals with DS. This study investigated two aspects of auditory functions, \"what\" (understanding the content of sound) and \"where\" (localizing the source of sound), in young adults with DS. Speech reception thresholds in quiet and in the presence of interferers provided insight into speech recognition, that is, the \"what\" aspect of auditory maturation. Insights into \"where\" aspect of auditory maturation were gained from evaluating speech reception thresholds in colocated versus separated conditions (quantifying spatial release from masking) as well as right versus left discrimination and sound location identification. Auditory functions in the \"where\" domain develop during earlier stages of cognitive development in contrast with the later developing \"what\" functions. We hypothesized that young adults with DS would exhibit stronger \"where\" than \"what\" auditory functioning, albeit with the potential impact of HL. Considering the importance of auditory working memory and receptive vocabulary for speech recognition, we hypothesized that better speech recognition in young adults with DS, in quiet and with speech interferers, would be associated with better auditory working memory ability and receptive vocabulary.\nDESIGN: Nineteen young adults with DS (aged 19 to 24 years) participated in the study and completed assessments on pure-tone audiometry, right versus left discrimination, sound location identification, and speech recognition in quiet and with speech interferers that were colocated or spatially separated. Results were compared with published data from children and adults without DS and HL, tested using similar protocols and stimuli. Digit Span tests assessed auditory working memory. Receptive vocabulary was examined using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Fifth Edition.\nRESULTS: Seven participants (37%) had HL in at least 1 ear; 4 individuals had mild HL, and 3 had moderate HL or worse. Participants with mild or no HL had ≥75% correct at 5° separation on the discrimination task and sound localization root mean square errors (mean ± SD: 8.73° ± 2.63°) within the range of adults in the comparison group. Speech reception thresholds in young adults with DS were higher than all comparison groups. However, spatial release from masking did not differ between young adults with DS and comparison groups. Better (lower) speech reception thresholds were associated with better hearing and better auditory working memory ability. Receptive vocabulary did not predict speech recognition.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the absence of HL, young adults with DS exhibited higher accuracy during spatial hearing tasks as compared with speech recognition tasks. Thus, auditory processes associated with the \"where\" pathways appear to be a relative strength than those associated with \"what\" pathways in young adults with DS. Further, both HL and auditory working memory impairments contributed to difficulties in speech recognition in the presence of speech interferers. Future larger-sized samples are needed to replicate and extend our findings.\nPMID:\n39090791\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001549",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: This study investigated the efficiency of a multiplexed amplitude-modulated (AM) stimulus in eliciting auditory steady-state responses. The multiplexed AM stimulus was created by simultaneously modulating speech-shaped noise with three frequencies chosen to elicit different neural generators: 3.1, 40.1, and 102.1 Hz. For comparison, a single AM stimulus was created for each of these frequencies, resulting in three single AM conditions and one multiplex AM condition.\nDESIGN: Twenty-two bilaterally normal-hearing participants (18 females) listened for 8 minutes to each type of stimuli. The analysis compared the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and amplitudes of the evoked responses to the single and multiplexed conditions.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that the SNRs elicited by single AM conditions were, on average, 1.61 dB higher than those evoked by the multiplexed AM condition ( p < 0.05). The single conditions consistently produced a significantly higher SNR when examining various stimulus durations ranging from 1 to 8 minutes. Despite these SNR differences, the frequency spectrum was very similar across and within subjects. In addition, the sensor space patterns across the scalp demonstrated similar trends between the single and multiplexed stimuli for both SNR and amplitudes. Both the single and multiplexed conditions evoked significant auditory steady-state responses within subjects. On average, the multiplexed AM stimulus took 31 minutes for the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval to cross the significance threshold across all three frequencies. In contrast, the single AM stimuli took 45 minutes and 42 seconds.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the multiplexed AM stimulus is a promising method to reduce the recording time when simultaneously obtaining information from various neural generators.\nPMID:\n39085997\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001552",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: The inter-phase gap (IPG) offset effect is defined as the dB offset between the linear parts of electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) amplitude growth functions for two stimuli differing only in IPG. The method was recently suggested to represent neural health in cochlear implant (CI) users while being unaffected by CI electrode impedances. Hereby, a larger IPG offset effect should reflect better neural health. The aims of the present study were to (1) examine whether the IPG offset effect negatively correlates with the ECAP threshold and the preoperative pure-tone average (PTA) in CI recipients with residual acoustic hearing and (2) investigate the dependency of the IPG offset effect on hair cell survival and intracochlear electrode impedances.\nDESIGN: Seventeen adult study participants with residual acoustic hearing at 500 Hz undergoing CI surgery at the University Hospital of Zurich were prospectively enrolled. ECAP thresholds, IPG offset effects, electrocochleography (ECochG) responses to 500 Hz tone bursts, and monopolar electrical impedances were obtained at an apical, middle, and basal electrode set during and between 4 and 12 weeks after CI surgery. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted within 3 weeks before surgery and approximately 6 weeks after surgery. Linear mixed regression analyses and t tests were performed to assess relationships between (changes in) ECAP threshold, IPG offset, impedance, PTA, and ECochG amplitude.\nRESULTS: The IPG offset effect positively correlated with the ECAP threshold in intraoperative recordings (p < 0.001) and did not significantly correlate with the preoperative PTA (p = 0.999). The IPG offset showed a postoperative decrease for electrode sets that showed an ECochG amplitude drop. This IPG offset decrease was significantly larger than for electrode sets that showed no ECochG amplitude decrease, t(17) = 2.76, p = 0.014. Linear mixed regression analysis showed no systematic effect of electrode impedance changes on the IPG offset effect (p = 0.263) but suggested a participant-dependent effect of electrode impedance on IPG offset.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study results did not reveal the expected relationships between the IPG offset effect and ECAP threshold values or between the IPG offset effect and preoperative acoustic hearing. Changes in electrode impedance did not exhibit a direct impact on the IPG offset effect, although this impact might be individualized among CI recipients. Overall, our findings suggest that the interpretation and application of the IPG offset effect in clinical settings should be approached with caution considering its complex relationships with other cochlear and neural health metrics.\nPMID:\n39054580\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001556",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: To explore postural disability in Usher Syndrome (USH) patients using temporal posturographic analysis to better elucidate sensory compensation strategies of deafblind patients for posture control and correlate the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale with posturographic variables.\nDESIGN: Thirty-four genetically confirmed USH patients (11 USH1, 21 USH2, 2 USH 4) from the Otolaryngology Outpatient Clinic and 35 controls were prospectively studied using both classical and wavelet temporal analysis of center of pressure (CoP) under different visual conditions on static and dynamic platforms. The functional impact of balance was assessed with the ABC scale. Classical data in the spatial domain, Sensorial Organization Test, and frequency analysis of the CoP were analyzed.\nRESULTS: On unstable surfaces, USH1 had greater CoP surface area with eyes open (38.51 ± 68.67) and closed (28.14 ± 31.64) versus controls (3.31 ± 4.60), p < 0.001 and (7.37 ± 7.91), p < 0.001, respectively. On an unstable platform, USH consistently showed increased postural sway, with elevated angular velocity versus controls with eyes open (USH1 [44.94 ± 62.54]; USH2 [55.64 ± 38.61]; controls [13.4 ± 8.57]) (p = 0.003; p < 0.001) and closed (USH1 [60.36 ± 49.85], USH2 [57.62 ± 42.36]; controls [27.31 ± 19.79]) (p = 0.002; p = 0.042). USH visual impairment appears to be the primary factor influencing postural deficits, with a statistically significant difference observed in the visual Sensorial Organization Test ratio for USH1 (80.73 ± 40.07, p = 0.04) and a highly significant difference for USH2 (75.48 ± 31.67, p < 0.001) versus controls (100). In contrast, vestibular (p = 0.08) and somatosensory (p = 0.537) factors did not reach statistical significance. USH exhibited lower visual dependence than controls (30.31 ± 30.08) (USH1 [6 ± 11.46], p = 0.004; USH2 [8 ± 14.15], p = 0.005). The postural instability index, that corresponds to the ratio of spectral power index and canceling time, differentiated USH from controls on unstable surface with eyes open USH1 (3.33 ± 1.85) p < 0.001; USH2 (3.87 ± 1.05) p < 0.002; controls (1.91 ± 0.85) and closed USH1 (3.91 ± 1.65) p = 0.005; USH2 (3.92 ± 1.05) p = 0.045; controls (2.74 ± 1.27), but not USH1 from USH2. The canceling time in the anteroposterior direction in lower zone distinguished USH subtypes on stable surface with optokinetic USH1 (0.88 ± 1.03), USH2 (0.29 ± 0.23), p = 0.026 and on unstable surface with eyes open USH1 (0.56 ± 1.26), USH2 (0.072 ± 0.09), p = 0.036. ABC scale could distinguish between USH patients and controls, but not between USH subtypes and it correlated with CoP surface area on unstable surface with eyes open only in USH1(ρ = 0.714, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSIONS: USH patients, particularly USH1, exhibited poorer balance control than controls on unstable platform with eyes open and appeared to rely more on proprioceptive information while suppressing visual input. USH2 seems to use different multisensory balance strategies that do not align as well with the ABC scale. The advanced analysis provided insights into sensory compensation strategies in USH subtypes.\nPMID:\n39049080\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001558",

It is important to note that it can be enhanced by nonauditory stimuli, for example, through lip-reading in an ongoing conversation. However, how tactile stimuli affect auditory processing is still relatively unclear. Recent studies have shown that brief tactile stimuli can reliably facilitate auditory perception, while studies using longer-lasting audio-tactile stimulation yielded conflicting results. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ongoing pulsating tactile stimulation on basic auditory processing.\nDESIGN: In experiment 1, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while 24 participants performed a loudness-discrimination task on a 4-Hz modulated tone-in-noise and received either in-phase, anti-phase, or no 4-Hz electrotactile stimulation above the median nerve. In experiment 2, another 24 participants were presented with the same tactile stimulation as before, but performed a tone-in-noise detection task while their selective auditory attention was manipulated.\nRESULTS: We found that in-phase tactile stimulation enhanced EEG responses to the tone, whereas anti-phase tactile stimulation suppressed these responses. No corresponding tactile effects on loudness-discrimination performance were observed in experiment 1. Using a yes/no paradigm in experiment 2, we found that in-phase tactile stimulation, but not anti-phase tactile stimulation, improved detection thresholds. Selective attention also improved thresholds but did not modulate the observed benefit from in-phase tactile stimulation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that ongoing in-phase tactile input can enhance basic auditory processing as reflected in scalp EEG and detection thresholds. This might have implications for the development of hearing enhancement technologies and interventions.\nPMID:\n39046790\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001566",

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bilateral CI compared with bimodal hearing for children with sensorineural hearing loss in Taiwan from both the perspectives of patients and Taiwan's National Health Insurance Administration (TNHIA).\nDESIGN: A four-state Markov model was utilized in the study, including \"use the first internal device,\" \"use the second internal device,\" \"use the third internal device,\" and \"death.\" Health utility values were obtained from a local survey of health professionals and then adjusted by a scale to reflect both the negative impact of aging on hearing and the time needed to develop the full benefit of treatment in the earliest years of life. The cost data were derived from a caregiver survey, hospital databases, clinical experts, and the TNHIA. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over the lifetime horizon and presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous bilateral CI, sequential bilateral CI, and bimodal hearing. In addition, one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of uncertainty and the robustness of the model.\nRESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that children with bilateral CI gained more QALYs while incurring more costs when compared with those with bimodal hearing. From the TNHIA perspective, compared with bimodal hearing, the ICER of simultaneous bilateral CI was New Taiwan Dollars 232,662 per QALY whereas from the patient perspective, the ICER was New Taiwan Dollars 1,006,965 per QALY. Moreover, simultaneous bilateral CI dominated sequential bilateral CI from both perspectives. Compared with bimodal hearing, the ICER of sequential bilateral CI did not exceed twice the gross domestic product per capita in Taiwan from either perspective. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the utility gain of bilateral CI compared with bimodal hearing was the most impactful parameter from both perspectives. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base-case analysis results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that bilateral CI was cost-effective when using the threshold of one to three times the 2022 gross domestic product per capita in Taiwan from both the TNHIA and patient perspectives. Future research incorporating cost and effectiveness data from other dimensions is needed to help decision-makers assess the cost-effectiveness of bilateral CI more comprehensively.\nPMID:\n39044334\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001568",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of two types of auditory training on both behavioral and physiological measures of auditory function in cochlear implant (CI) users, and to examine whether a relationship exists between the behavioral and objective outcome measures.\nDESIGN: This study involved two experiments, both of which used a within-subject design. Outcome measures included behavioral and cortical electrophysiological measures of auditory processing. In Experiment I, 8 CI users participated in a music-based auditory training. The training program included both short training sessions completed in the laboratory as well as a set of 12 training sessions that participants completed at home over the course of a month. As part of the training program, study participants listened to a range of different musical stimuli and were asked to discriminate stimuli that differed in pitch or timbre and to identify melodic changes. Performance was assessed before training and at three intervals during and after training was completed. In Experiment II, 20 CI users participated in a more focused auditory training task: the detection of spectral ripple modulation depth. Training consisted of a single 40-minute session that took place in the laboratory under the supervision of the investigators. Behavioral and physiologic measures of spectral ripple modulation depth detection were obtained immediately pre- and post-training. Data from both experiments were analyzed using mixed linear regressions, paired t tests, correlations, and descriptive statistics.\nRESULTS: In Experiment I, there was a significant improvement in behavioral measures of pitch discrimination after the study participants completed the laboratory and home-based training sessions. There was no significant effect of training on electrophysiologic measures of the auditory N1-P2 onset response and acoustic change complex (ACC). There were no significant relationships between electrophysiologic measures and behavioral outcomes after the month-long training. In Experiment II, there was no significant effect of training on the ACC, although there was a small but significant improvement in behavioral spectral ripple modulation depth thresholds after the short-term training.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that auditory training improves spectral cue perception in CI users, with significant perceptual gains observed despite cortical electrophysiological responses like the ACC not reliably predicting training benefits across short- and long-term interventions. Future research should further explore individual factors that may lead to greater benefit from auditory training, in addition to optimization of training protocols and outcome measures, as well as demonstrate the generalizability of these findings.\nPMID:\n39044323\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001569",

However, a substantial and unexplained variability persists in CI outcomes, even when considering subject-specific factors such as age and the duration of deafness. In a pioneering study, we use resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to predict speech-understanding outcomes before and after CI implantation. Our hypothesis centers on resting-state functional connectivity (FC) reflecting brain plasticity post-hearing loss and implantation, specifically targeting the average clustering coefficient in resting FC networks to capture variation among CI users.\nDESIGN: Twenty-three CI candidates participated in this study. Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy data were collected preimplantation and at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postimplantation. Speech understanding performance was assessed using consonant-nucleus-consonant words in quiet and Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentences in noise 1-year postimplantation. Resting-state FC networks were constructed using regularized partial correlation, and the average clustering coefficient was measured in the signed weighted networks as a predictive measure for implantation outcomes.\nRESULTS: Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between the average clustering coefficient in resting-state functional networks and speech understanding outcomes, both pre- and postimplantation.\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach uses an easily deployable resting-state functional brain imaging metric to predict speech-understanding outcomes in implant recipients.

This study aimed to objectively determine intraoperative cochlear microphonic (CM) amplitude patterns and correlate them with residual hearing in cochlear implant recipients, addressing the limitations in current ECochG analysis that often depends on subjective visual assessment and overlook the intracochlear measurement location.\nDESIGN: In this prospective study, we investigated intraoperative pure-tone ECochG following complete electrode insertion in 31 patients. We used our previously published objective analysis method to determine the maximum CM amplitude and the associated electrode position for each electrode array. Using computed tomography, we identified electrode placement and determined the corresponding tonotopic frequency using Greenwood's function. Based on this, we calculated the tonotopic shift, that is, the difference between the stimulation frequency and the estimated frequency of the electrode with the maximum CM amplitude. We evaluated the association between CM amplitude, tonotopic shift, and preoperative hearing thresholds using linear regression analysis.\nRESULTS: CM amplitudes showed high variance, with values ranging from -1.479 to 4.495 dBµV. We found a statistically significant negative correlation ( ) between maximum CM amplitudes and preoperative hearing thresholds. In addition, a significant association ( ) between the tonotopic shift and preoperative hearing thresholds was observed. Tonotopic shifts of the maximum CM amplitudes occurred predominantly toward the basal direction.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of objective signal analysis and the consideration of intracochlear measurement locations enhances the understanding of cochlear health and overcomes the obstacles of current ECochG analysis. We could show the link between intraoperative CM amplitudes, their spatial distributions, and preoperative hearing thresholds. Consequently, our findings enable automated analysis and bear the potential to enhance specificity of ECochG, reinforcing its role as an objective biomarker for cochlear health.\nPMID:\n39010266\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001546",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Cochlear implants (CI) are remarkably effective, but have limitations regarding the transformation of the spectro-temporal fine structures of speech. This may impair processing of spoken emotions, which involves the identification and integration of semantic and prosodic cues. Our previous study found spoken-emotions-processing differences between CI users with postlingual deafness (postlingual CI) and normal hearing (NH) matched controls (age range, 19 to 65 years). Postlingual CI users over-relied on semantic information in incongruent trials (prosody and semantics present different emotions), but rated congruent trials (same emotion) similarly to controls. Postlingual CI's intact early auditory experience may explain this pattern of results. The present study examined whether CI users without intact early auditory experience (prelingual CI) would generally perform worse on spoken emotion processing than NH and postlingual CI users, and whether CI use would affect prosodic processing in both CI groups. First, we compared prelingual CI users with their NH controls. Second, we compared the results of the present study to our previous study (Taitlebaum-Swead et al. 2022; postlingual CI).\nDESIGN: Fifteen prelingual CI users and 15 NH controls (age range, 18 to 31 years) listened to spoken sentences composed of different combinations (congruent and incongruent) of three discrete emotions (anger, happiness, sadness) and neutrality (performance baseline), presented in prosodic and semantic channels (Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech paradigm). Listeners were asked to rate (six-point scale) the extent to which each of the predefined emotions was conveyed by the sentence as a whole (integration of prosody and semantics), or to focus only on one channel (rating the target emotion [RTE]) and ignore the other (selective attention). In addition, all participants performed standard tests of speech perception. Performance on the Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech was compared with the previous study (postlingual CI).\nRESULTS: When asked to focus on one channel, semantics or prosody, both CI groups showed a decrease in prosodic RTE (compared with controls), but only the prelingual CI group showed a decrease in semantic RTE. When the task called for channel integration, both groups of CI users used semantic emotional information to a greater extent than their NH controls. Both groups of CI users rated sentences that did not present the target emotion higher than their NH controls, indicating some degree of confusion. However, only the prelingual CI group rated congruent sentences lower than their NH controls, suggesting reduced accumulation of information across channels. For prelingual CI users, individual differences in identification of monosyllabic words were significantly related to semantic identification and semantic-prosodic integration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together with our previous study, we found that the degradation of acoustic information by the CI impairs the processing of prosodic emotions, in both CI user groups. This distortion appears to lead CI users to over-rely on the semantic information when asked to integrate across channels. Early intact auditory exposure among CI users was found to be necessary for the effective identification of semantic emotions, as well as the accumulation of emotional information across the two channels. Results suggest that interventions for spoken-emotion processing should not ignore the onset of hearing loss.\nPMID:\n39004788\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001550",

We aim to provide a comprehensive view of the auditory processing abilities for subjects with acquired AHL, and to examine the influence of AHL on speech perception under difficult conditions, and on auditory temporal and intensity processing.\nDESIGN: We examined peripheral and central auditory functions for 25 subjects with AHL resulting from vestibular schwannoma, and compared them to those from 24 normal-hearing controls that were matched with the AHL subjects in mean age and hearing thresholds in the healthy ear. Besides the basic hearing threshold assessment, the tests comprised the detection of tones and gaps in a continuous noise, comprehension of speech in babble noise, binaural interactions, difference limen of intensity, and detection of frequency modulation. For the AHL subjects, the selected tests were performed separately for the healthy and diseased ear.\nRESULTS: We observed that binaural speech comprehension, gap detection, and frequency modulation detection abilities were dominated by the healthy ear and were comparable for both groups. The AHL subjects were less sensitive to interaural delays, however, they exhibited a higher sensitivity to sound level, as indicated by lower difference limen of intensity and a higher sensitivity to interaural intensity difference. Correlations between the individual test scores indicated that speech comprehension by the AHL subjects was associated with different auditory processing mechanisms than for the control subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that AHL influences both peripheral and central auditory processing abilities and that speech comprehension under difficult conditions relies on different mechanisms for the AHL subjects than for normal-hearing controls.\nPMID:\n39004787\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001555",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS) combines electric stimulation via a cochlear implant (CI) with residual low-frequency acoustic hearing, with benefits for music appreciation and speech perception in noise. However, many EAS CI users lose residual acoustic hearing, reducing this benefit. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether chronic EAS leads to more hearing loss compared with CI surgery alone in an aged guinea pig model, and to assess the relationship of any hearing loss to histology measures. Conversely, it is also important to understand factors impacting efficacy of electric stimulation. If one contributor to CI-induced hearing loss is damage to the auditory nerve, both acoustic and electric thresholds will be affected. Excitotoxicity from EAS may also affect electric thresholds, while electric stimulation is osteogenic and may increase electrode impedances. Hence, secondary objectives were to assess how electric thresholds are related to the amount of residual hearing loss after CI surgery, and how EAS affects electric thresholds and impedances over time.\nDESIGN: Two groups of guinea pigs, aged 9 to 21 months, were implanted with a CI in the left ear. Preoperatively, the animals had a range of hearing losses, as expected for an aged cohort. At 4 weeks after surgery, the EAS group (n = 5) received chronic EAS for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 20 weeks via a tether system that allowed for free movement during stimulation. The nonstimulated group (NS; n = 6) received no EAS over the same timeframe. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and electrically evoked ABRs (EABRs) were recorded at 3 to 4 week intervals to assess changes in acoustic and electric thresholds over time. At 24 weeks after surgery, cochlear tissue was harvested for histological evaluation, only analyzing animals without electrode extrusions (n = 4 per ear).\nRESULTS: Cochlear implantation led to an immediate worsening of ABR thresholds peaking between 3 and 5 weeks after surgery and then recovering and stabilizing by 5 and 8 weeks. Significantly greater ABR threshold shifts were seen in the implanted ears compared with contralateral, non-implanted control ears after surgery. After EAS and termination, no significant additional ABR threshold shifts were seen in the EAS group compared with the NS group. A surprising finding was that NS animals had significantly greater recovery in EABR thresholds over time, with decreases (improvements) of -51.8 ± 33.0 and -39.0 ± 37.3 c.u. at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, compared with EAS animals with EABR threshold increases (worsening) of +1.0 ± 25.6 and 12.8 ± 44.3 c.u. at 12 and 24 weeks. Impedance changes over time did not differ significantly between groups. After exclusion of cases with electrode extrusion or significant trauma, no significant correlations were seen between ABR and EABR thresholds, or between ABR thresholds with histology measures of inner/outer hair cell counts, synaptic ribbon counts, stria vascularis capillary diameters, or spiral ganglion cell density.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings do not indicate that EAS significantly disrupts acoustic hearing, although the small sample size limits this interpretation. No evidence of associations between hair cell, synaptic ribbon, spiral ganglion cell, or stria vascularis with hearing loss after cochlear implantation was seen when surgical trauma is minimized. In cases of major trauma, both acoustic thresholds and electric thresholds were elevated, which may explain why CI-only outcomes are often better when trauma and hearing loss are minimized. Surprisingly, chronic EAS (or electric stimulation alone) may negatively impact electric thresholds, possibly by prevention of recovery of the auditory nerve after CI surgery. More research is needed to confirm the potentially negative impact of chronic EAS on electric threshold recovery.\nPMID:\n38992863\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001545",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe discovery and development of electrocochleography (ECochG) in animal models has been fundamental for its implementation in clinical audiology and neurotology. In our laboratory, the use of round-window ECochG recordings in chinchillas has allowed a better understanding of auditory efferent functioning. In previous works, we gave evidence of the corticofugal modulation of auditory-nerve and cochlear responses during visual attention and working memory. However, whether these cognitive top-down mechanisms to the most peripheral structures of the auditory pathway are also active during audiovisual crossmodal stimulation is unknown. Here, we introduce a new technique, wireless ECochG to record compound-action potentials of the auditory nerve (CAP), cochlear microphonics (CM), and round-window noise (RWN) in awake chinchillas during a paradigm of crossmodal (visual and auditory) stimulation. We compared ECochG data obtained from four awake chinchillas recorded with a wireless ECochG system with wired ECochG recordings from six anesthetized animals. Although ECochG experiments with the wireless system had a lower signal-to-noise ratio than wired recordings, their quality was sufficient to compare ECochG potentials in awake crossmodal conditions. We found non-significant differences in CAP and CM amplitudes in response to audiovisual stimulation compared to auditory stimulation alone (clicks and tones). On the other hand, spontaneous auditory-nerve activity (RWN) was modulated by visual crossmodal stimulation, suggesting that visual crossmodal simulation can modulate spontaneous but not evoked auditory-nerve activity. However, given the limited sample of 10 animals (4 wireless and 6 wired), these results should be interpreted cautiously. Future experiments are required to substantiate these conclusions. In addition, we introduce the use of wireless ECochG in animal models as a useful tool for translational research.\nPMID:\n39094370\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109093",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nMusicians are at risk of hearing loss and tinnitus due to regular exposure to high levels of noise. This level of risk may have been underestimated previously since damage to the auditory system, such as cochlear synaptopathy, may not be easily detectable using standard clinical measures. Most previous research investigating hearing loss in musicians has involved cross-sectional study designs that may capture only a snapshot of hearing health in relation to noise exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cumulative noise exposure on behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report indices of hearing damage in early-career musicians and non-musicians with normal hearing over a 2-year period. Participants completed an annual test battery consisting of pure tone audiometry, extended high-frequency hearing thresholds, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), speech perception in noise, auditory brainstem responses, and self-report measures of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and hearing in background noise. Participants also completed the Noise Exposure Structured Interview to estimate cumulative noise exposure across the study period. Linear mixed models assessed changes over time. The longitudinal analysis comprised 64 early-career musicians (female n = 34; age range at T0 = 18-26 years) and 30 non-musicians (female n = 20; age range at T0 = 18-27 years). There were few longitudinal changes as a result of musicianship. Small improvements over time in some measures may be attributable to a practice/test-retest effect. Some measures (e.g., DPOAE indices of outer hair cell function) were associated with noise exposure at each time point, but did not show a significant change over time. A small proportion of participants reported a worsening of their tinnitus symptoms, which participants attributed to noise exposure, or not using hearing protection. Future longitudinal studies should attempt to capture the effects of noise exposure over a longer period, taken at several time points, for a precise measure of how hearing changes over time. Hearing conservation programmes for \"at risk\" individuals should closely monitor DPOAEs to detect early signs of noise-induced hearing loss when audiometric thresholds are clinically normal.\nPMID:\n39084132\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109077",

A new mouse allele, Sgms1\ntm1a\n, unexpectedly showed normal Auditory Brainstem Response thresholds. We found that the Sgms1\ntm1a\nmutation led to incomplete knockdown of transcript to 20 % of normal values, which was enough to support normal hearing. The Sgms1\ntm1b\nallele was generated by knocking out exon 7, leading to a complete lack of detectable transcript in the inner ear. Sgms1\ntm1b\nhomozygotes showed largely normal auditory brainstem response thresholds at first, followed by progressive loss of sensitivity until they showed severe impairment at 6 months old. The endocochlear potential was consistently reduced in Sgms1\ntm1b\nmutants at 3, 4 and 8 weeks old, to around 80 mV compared with around 120 mV in control littermates. The stria vascularis showed a characteristic irregularity of marginal cell surfaces and patchy loss of Kcnq1 expression at their apical membrane, and expression analysis of the lateral wall suggested that marginal cells were the most likely initial site of dysfunction in the mutants. Finally, significant association of auditory thresholds with DNA markers within and close to the human SGMS1 gene were found in the 1958 Birth Cohort, suggesting that SGMS1 variants may play a role in the range of hearing abilities in the human population.\nPMID:\n39067415\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109091",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nMusicians perform better than non-musicians on a variety of non-musical sound-perception tasks. Whether that musicians' advantage extends to spatial hearing is a topic of increasing interest. Here we investigated one facet of that topic by assessing musicians' and non-musicians' sensitivity to the two primary cues to sound-source location on the horizontal plane: interaural-level-differences (ILDs) and interaural-time-differences (ITDs). Specifically, we measured discrimination thresholds for ILDs at 4 kHz (n =246) and ITDs at 0.5 kHz (n = 137) in participants whose musical-training histories covered a wide range of lengths, onsets, and offsets. For ILD discrimination, when only musical-training length was considered in the analysis, no musicians' advantage was apparent. However, when thresholds were compared between subgroups of non-musicians (<2 years of training) and extreme musicians (≥10 years of training, started ≤ age 7, still playing) a musicians' advantage emerged. Threshold comparisons between the extreme musicians and other subgroups of highly trained musicians (≥10 years of training) further indicated that the advantage required both starting young and continuing to play. In addition, the advantage was larger in males than in females, by some measures, and was not evident in an assessment of learning. For ITD discrimination, in contrast to ILD discrimination, parallel analyses revealed no apparent musicians' advantage. The results suggest that musicianship is associated with greater sensitivity to ILDs, a fundamental sound-localization cue, even though that sensitivity is not central to music, that this musicians' advantage arises, at least in part, from nurture, and that it is governed by a neural substrate where ILDs are processed separately from, and more malleably than, ITDs.\nPMID:\n39053298\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109078",

This phenomenon is particularly significant in individuals with deafness, as the brain adapts to compensate for the lack of auditory stimulation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether cochlear implantation can restore a normal pattern of brain activation following auditory stimulation in cases of asymmetric hearing loss. We used a PET-scan technique to assess brain activity after cochlear implantation, specifically during an auditory voice/non-voice discrimination task. The results indicated a nearly normal pattern of brain activity during the auditory discrimination task, except for increased activation in areas related to attentional processes compared to controls. Additionally, brain activity at rest showed significant changes in implanted participants, including cross modal visuo-auditory processing. Therefore, cochlear implants can restore the brain's activation pattern through long-term adaptive adjustments in intrinsic brain activity.\nPMID:\n39053297\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109079",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVE: The acoustic change complex (ACC) is a cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) and can be elicited by a change in an otherwise continuous sound. The ACC has been highlighted as a promising tool in the assessment of sound and speech discrimination capacity, and particularly for difficult-to-test populations such as infants with hearing loss, due to the objective nature of ACC measurements. Indeed, there is a pressing need to develop further means to accurately and thoroughly establish the hearing status of children with hearing loss, to help guide hearing interventions in a timely manner. Despite the potential of the ACC method, ACC measurements remain relatively rare in a standard clinical settings. The objective of this study was to perform an up-to-date systematic review on ACC measurements in children, to provide greater clarity and consensus on the possible methodologies, applications, and performance of this technique, and to facilitate its uptake in relevant clinical settings.\nDESIGN: Original peer-reviewed articles conducting ACC measurements in children (< 18 years). Data were extracted and summarised for: (1) participant characteristics; (2) ACC methods and auditory stimuli; (3) information related to the performance of the ACC technique; (4) ACC measurement outcomes, advantages, and challenges. The systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines for reporting and the methodological quality of included articles was assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 28 studies were identified (9 infant studies). Review results show that ACC responses can be measured in infants (from < 3 months), and there is evidence of age-dependency, including increased robustness of the ACC response with increasing childhood age. Clinical applications include the measurement of the neural capacity for speech and non-speech sound discrimination in children with hearing loss, auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). Additionally, ACCs can be recorded in children with hearing aids, auditory brainstem implants, and cochlear implants, and ACC results may guide hearing intervention/rehabilitation strategies. The review identified that the time taken to perform ACC measurements was often lengthy; the development of more efficient ACC test procedures for children would be beneficial. Comparisons between objective ACC measurements and behavioural measures of sound discrimination showed significant correlations for some, but not all, included studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: ACC measurements of the neural capacity to discriminate between speech and non-speech sounds are feasible in infants and children, and a wide range of possible clinical applications exist, although more time-efficient procedures would be advantageous for clinical uptake. A consideration of age and maturational effects is recommended, and further research is required to investigate the relationship between objective ACC measures and behavioural measures of sound and speech perception for effective clinical implementation.\nPMID:\n39047579\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109090",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nCombining a cochlear implant with contralateral acoustic hearing typically enhances speech understanding, although this improvement varies among CI users and can lead to an interference effect. This variability may be associated with the effectiveness of the integration between electric and acoustic stimulation, which might be affected by the temporal mismatch between the two listening sides. Finding methods to compensate for the temporal mismatch might contribute to the optimal adjustment of bimodal devices and to improve hearing in CI users with contralateral acoustic hearing. The current study investigates cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in normal hearing listeners (NH) and CI users with contralateral acoustic hearing. In NH, the amplitude of the N1 peak and the maximum phase locking value (PLV) were analyzed under monaural, binaural, and binaural temporally mismatched conditions. In CI users, CAEPs were measured when listening with CI only (CIS_only), acoustically only (AS_only) and with both sides together (CIS+AS). When listening with CIS+AS, various interaural delays were introduced between the electric and acoustic stimuli. In NH listeners, interaural temporal mismatch resulted in decreased N1 amplitude and PLV. Moreover, PLV is suggested as a more sensitive measure to investigate the integration of information between the two listening sides. CI users showed varied N1 latencies between the AS_only and CIS_only listening conditions, with increased N1 amplitude when the temporal mismatch was compensated. A tendency towards increased PLV was also observed, however, to a lesser extent than in NH listeners, suggesting a limited integration between electric and acoustic stimulation. This work highlights the potential of CAEPs measurement to investigate cortical processing of the information between two listening sides in NH and bimodal CI users.\nPMID:\n39032483\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109088",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nMany children with profound hearing loss have received cochlear implants (CI) to help restore some sense of hearing. There is, however, limited research on long-term neurocognitive outcomes in young adults who have grown up hearing through a CI. This study compared the cognitive outcomes of early-implanted (n = 20) and late-implanted (n = 21) young adult CI users, and typically hearing (TH) controls (n=56), all of whom were enrolled in college. Cognitive fluidity, nonverbal intelligence, and American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension were assessed, revealing no significant differences in cognition and nonverbal intelligence between the early and late-implanted groups. However, there was a difference in ASL comprehension, with the late-implanted group having significantly higher ASL comprehension. Although young adult CI users showed significantly lower scores in a working memory and processing speed task than TH age-matched controls, there were no significant differences in tasks involving executive function shifting, inhibitory control, and episodic memory between young adult CI and young adult TH participants. In an exploratory analysis of a subset of CI participants (n = 17) in whom we were able to examine crossmodal plasticity, we saw greater evidence of crossmodal recruitment from the visual system in late-implanted compared with early-implanted CI young adults. However, cortical visual evoked potential latency biomarkers of crossmodal plasticity were not correlated with cognitive measures or ASL comprehension. The results suggest that in the late-implanted CI users, early access to sign language may have served as a scaffold for appropriate cognitive development, while in the early-implanted group early access to oral language benefited cognitive development. Furthermore, our results suggest that the persistence of crossmodal neuroplasticity into adulthood does not necessarily impact cognitive development. In conclusion, early access to language - spoken or signed - may be important for cognitive development, with no observable effect of crossmodal plasticity on cognitive outcomes.\nPMID:\n39018768\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109074",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nAuditory masking methods originally employed to assess behavioral frequency selectivity have evolved over the years to infer cochlear tuning. Behavioral forward masking thresholds for spectrally notched noise maskers and a fixed, low-level probe tone provide accurate estimates of cochlear tuning. Here, we use this method to investigate the effect of stimulus duration on human cochlear tuning at 500 Hz and 4 kHz. Probes were 20-ms sinusoids at 10 dB sensation level. Maskers were noises with a spectral notch symmetrically and asymmetrically placed around the probe frequency. For seven participants with normal hearing, masker levels at masking threshold were measured in forward masking for various notch widths and for masker durations of 30 and 400 ms. Measurements were fitted assuming rounded exponential filter shapes and the power spectrum model of masking, and equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs) were inferred from the fits. At 4 kHz, masker thresholds were higher for the shorter maskers but ERBs were not significantly different for the two masker durations (ERB\n30ms\n=294 Hz vs. ERB\n400ms\n=277 Hz). At 500 Hz, by contrast, notched-noise curves were shallower for the 30-ms than the 400-ms masker, and ERBs were significantly broader for the shorter masker (ERB\n30ms\n=126 Hz vs. ERB\n400ms\n=55 Hz). We discuss possible factors that may underlay the duration effect at low frequencies and argue that it may not be possible to fully control for those factors. We conclude that tuning estimates are not affected by maker duration at high frequencies but should be measured and interpreted with caution at low frequencies.\nPMID:\n39004016\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109080",

We assess whether auditory cognitive ability, in particular short-term memory for sound features, contributes to both. We examined how auditory memory for fundamental sound features, the carrier frequency and amplitude modulation rate of modulated white noise, contributes to SIN perception. We assessed SIN in 153 healthy participants with varying degrees of hearing loss using measures that require single-digit perception (the Digits-in-Noise, DIN) and sentence perception (Speech-in-Babble, SIB). Independent variables were auditory memory and a range of other factors including the Pure Tone Audiogram (PTA), a measure of dichotic pitch-in-noise perception (Huggins pitch), and demographic variables including age and sex. Multiple linear regression models were compared using Bayesian Model Comparison. The best predictor model for DIN included PTA and Huggins pitch (r\n2\n= 0.32, p < 0.001), whereas the model for SIB included the addition of auditory memory for sound features (r\n2\n= 0.24, p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that auditory memory also explained a significant portion of the variance (28 %) in scores for a screening cognitive test for dementia. Auditory memory for non-speech sounds may therefore provide an important predictor of both SIN and cognitive ability.\nPMID:\n39004015\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109081",

Successful prediction of formal (e.g., type) and temporal sound characteristics facilitates the filtering of irrelevant information, also labelled as 'sensory gating' (SG). Here, we explored if and how parallel manipulations of formal prediction violations and temporal predictability affect SG in persons with and without tinnitus. Age-, education- and sex-matched persons with and without tinnitus (N = 52) participated and listened to paired-tone oddball sequences, varying in formal (standard vs. deviant pitch) and temporal predictability (isochronous vs. random timing). EEG was recorded from 128 channels and data were analyzed by means of temporal spatial principal component analysis (tsPCA). SG was assessed by amplitude suppression for the 2nd tone in a pair and was observed in P50-like activity in both timing conditions and groups. Correspondingly, deviants elicited overall larger amplitudes than standards. However, only persons without tinnitus displayed a larger N100-like deviance response in the isochronous compared to the random timing condition. This result might imply that persons with tinnitus do not benefit similarly as persons without tinnitus from temporal predictability in deviance processing. Thus, persons with tinnitus might display less temporal sensitivity in auditory processing than persons without tinnitus.\nPMID:\n38996530\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109073",

Data were collected from 20 children with prelingual SSD who received a CI before the age of 2.5 years, from the initial activation of the sound processor until the children were 4.8 to 11.0 years old. Daily device use was extracted from the CI's data logging, while word perception in quiet was assessed using direct audio input to the children's sound processor. The children's caregivers completed a questionnaire about habits, motivations, and barriers to device use. The children with SSD and a CI used their device on average 8.3 h per day, corresponding to 63 % of their time spent awake. All children except one could understand speech through the CI, with an average score of 59 % on a closed-set test and 73 % on an open-set test. More device use was associated with higher speech perception scores. Parents were happy with their decision to pursue a CI for their child. Certain habits, like taking off the sound processor during illness, were associated with lower device use. Providing timely counselling to the children's parents, focused on SSD-specific challenges, may be helpful to improve daily device use in these children.\nPMID:\n38991628\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109076",

It remains unclear whether asymmetric pulses emphasizing the anodic or cathodic phase may improve spectral and temporal coding with CIs. This study tested place- and temporal-pitch sensitivity with C-BP, anodic-centered triphasic (A-TP), and cathodic-centered triphasic (C-TP) pulse trains on apical, middle, and basal electrodes in 10 implanted ears. Virtual channel ranking (VCR) thresholds (for place-pitch sensitivity) were measured at both a low and a high pulse rate of 99 (Experiment 1) and 1000 (Experiment 2) pulses per second (pps), and amplitude modulation frequency ranking (AMFR) thresholds (for temporal-pitch sensitivity) were measured at a 1000-pps pulse rate in Experiment 3. All stimuli were presented in monopolar mode. Results of all experiments showed that detection thresholds, most comfortable levels (MCLs), VCR thresholds, and AMFR thresholds were higher on more basal electrodes. C-BP pulses had longer active phase duration and thus lower detection thresholds and MCLs than A-TP and C-TP pulses. Compared to C-TP pulses, A-TP pulses had lower detection thresholds at the 99-pps but not the 1000-pps pulse rate, and had lower MCLs at both pulse rates. A-TP pulses led to lower VCR thresholds than C-BP pulses, and in turn than C-TP pulses, at the 1000-pps pulse rate. However, pulse shape did not affect VCR thresholds at the 99-pps pulse rate (possibly due to the fixed temporal pitch) or AMFR thresholds at the 1000-pps pulse rate (where the overall high performance may have reduced the changes with different pulse shapes). Notably, stronger polarity effect on VCR thresholds (or more improvement in VCR with A-TP than with C-TP pulses) at the 1000-pps pulse rate was associated with stronger polarity effect on detection thresholds at the 99-pps pulse rate (consistent with more degeneration of auditory nerve peripheral processes). The results suggest that A-TP pulses may improve place-pitch sensitivity or spectral coding for CI users, especially in situations with peripheral process degeneration.\nPMID:\n38986164\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109075",

Epub 2024 Jun 14.\nABSTRACT\nCholinergic signaling is essential to mediate the auditory prepulse inhibition (PPI), an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, that refers to the reduction of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) when a low-intensity, non-startling acoustic stimulus (the prepulse) is presented just before the onset of the acoustic startle stimulus. The cochlear root neurons (CRNs) are the first cells of the ASR circuit to receive cholinergic inputs from non-olivocochlear neurons of the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) and subsequently decrease their neuronal activity in response to auditory prepulses. Yet, the contribution of the VNTB-CRNs pathway to the mediation of PPI has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we used the immunotoxin anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-saporin as well as electrolytic lesions of the medial olivocochlear bundle to selectively eliminate cholinergic VNTB neurons, and then assessed the ASR and PPI paradigms. Retrograde track-tracing experiments were conducted to precisely determine the site of lesioning VNTB neurons projecting to the CRNs. Additionally, the effects of VNTB lesions and the integrity of the auditory pathway were evaluated via auditory brain responses tests, ChAT- and FOS-immunohistochemistry. Consequently, we established three experimental groups: 1) intact control rats (non-lesioned), 2) rats with bilateral lesions of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB-lesioned), and 3) rats with bilateral immunolesions affecting both the olivocochlear bundle and the VNTB (OCB/VNTB-lesioned). All experimental groups underwent ASR and PPI tests at several interstimulus intervals before the lesion and 7, 14, and 21 days after it. Our results show that the ASR amplitude remained unaffected both before and after the lesion across all experimental groups, suggesting that the VNTB does not contribute to the ASR. The%PPI increased across the time points of evaluation in the control and OCB-lesioned groups but not in the OCB/VNTB-lesioned group. At the ISI of 50 ms, the OCB-lesioned group exhibited a significant increase in%PPI (p < 0.01), which did not occur in the OCB/VNTB-lesioned group. Therefore, the ablation of cholinergic non-olivocochlear neurons in the OCB/VNTB-lesioned group suggests that these neurons contribute to the mediation of auditory PPI at the 50 ms ISI through their cholinergic projections to CRNs. Our study strongly reinforces the notion that auditory PPI encompasses a complex mechanism of top-down cholinergic modulation, effectively attenuating the ASR across different interstimulus intervals within multiple pathways.\nPMID:\n38972084\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109070",

Epub 2024 Jun 18.\nABSTRACT\nFollowing adult-onset hearing impairment, crossmodal plasticity can occur within various sensory cortices, often characterized by increased neural responses to visual stimulation in not only the auditory cortex, but also in the visual and audiovisual cortices. In the present study, we used an established model of loud noise exposure in rats to examine, for the first time, whether the crossmodal plasticity in the audiovisual cortex that occurs following a relatively mild degree of hearing loss emerges solely from altered intracortical processing or if thalamocortical changes also contribute to the crossmodal effects. Using a combination of an established pharmacological 'cortical silencing' protocol and current source density analysis of the laminar activity recorded across the layers of the audiovisual cortex (i.e., the lateral extrastriate visual cortex, V2L), we observed layer-specific changes post-silencing in the strength of the residual visual, but not auditory, input in the noise exposed rats with mild hearing loss compared to rats with normal hearing. Furthermore, based on a comparison of the laminar profiles pre- versus post-silencing in both groups, we can conclude that noise exposure caused a re-allocation of the strength of visual inputs across the layers of the V2L cortex, including enhanced visual-evoked activity in the granular layer; findings consistent with thalamocortical plasticity. Finally, we confirmed that audiovisual integration within the V2L cortex depends on intact processing within intracortical circuits, and that this form of multisensory processing is vulnerable to disruption by noise-induced hearing loss. Ultimately, the present study furthers our understanding of the contribution of intracortical and thalamocortical processing to crossmodal plasticity as well as to audiovisual integration under both normal and mildly-impaired hearing conditions.\nPMID:\n38941694\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109071",

Study 2 followed a repeated measures design in which digits-in-noise (DIN) tests were performed using wireless streaming to sound processors from Cochlear, Advanced Bionics, and MED-EL.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 20 normal hearing participants.\nRESULTS: Differences in frequency response between loudspeaker and wireless streaming conditions were minimal. We did not find significant difference in DIN outcome (F\n4,194\n= 1.062, p = 0.376) between the wireless transfer options with the Cochlear Nucleus 7 processor. No significant difference in DIN outcomes was found between Bluetooth streaming and the loudspeaker condition for all of the three tested brands. The mean standard error of measurement was 0.72 dB.\nCONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in DIN test outcomes between wireless sound transfer and the reference method were found.\nPMID:\n39101925\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2382201",

Study characteristics, prevalence, and contextual factors were synthesised and narratively described.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 30 peer-reviewed articles.\nRESULTS: Prevalence of permanent hearing loss per 1,000 children ranged from 0.32 to 77.87 (M = 7.30; SD = 16.87). Variations in the criteria for inclusion contributed to prevalence differences. Prevalence was higher when unilateral and milder degrees of hearing loss were included, and older children had higher prevalence (M = 13.71; SD = 23.21) than younger children (M = 1.57; SD = 0.86).\nCONCLUSION: There is scant research on prevalence of childhood hearing loss after NHS that utilised methods to accurately differentiate between permanent and temporary hearing loss. Rigorous research is needed on the prevalence of permanent childhood hearing loss to inform strategies for monitoring, identification, intervention, and management.\nPMID:\n39092923\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2385550",

The first variable was the level of subsidy provided for the citizens to obtain HAs. The second variable was the GNI/capita which reflects the income available to citizens to make the purchase of HAs.\nCONCLUSION: In countries where subsidy for HAs are made available through either public or private health service/insurance, an increase in coverage rates is likely to occur. The effect of subsidy is likely to surpass any effect of OTC HAs that has been demonstrated to date. Where and when feasible, subsidy presence and encouraging income generation among able citizens of a country should be sought in tandem - a complex interplay of improving coverage rates for HAs with economics.\nPMID:\n39091184\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2383988",

In this study we tested whether AGC synchronisation in a dual-loop front-end processing scheme with a 3:1 compression ratio improves sound localisation acuity.\nDESIGN: Source identification in the frontal hemifield was tested in in an anechoic chamber as a function of (roving) presentation level. Three different methods of AGC synchronisation were compared to the standard unsynchronised approach. Both root mean square error (RMSE) and signed bias were calculated to evaluate sound localisation in the horizontal plane.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Six BiCI users.\nRESULTS: None of the three AGC synchronisation methods yielded significant improvements in either localisation error or bias, neither across presentation levels nor for individual presentation levels. For synchronised AGC, the pooled mean (standard deviation) localisation error of the three synchronisation methods was 24.7 (5.8) degrees RMSE, for unsynchronised AGC it was 27.4 (7.5) degrees. The localisation bias was 5.1 (5.5) degrees for synchronised AGC and 5.0 (3.8) for unsynchronised.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support the hypothesis that the tested AGC synchronisation configurations improves localisation acuity in bilateral users of MED-EL cochlear implants.\nPMID:\n39075948\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2383700",

Here, we aimed to assess potential neural changes following TRT using mismatch negativity (MMN).\nDESIGN: Chronic tinnitus (>6 months) patients participated in a six-month TRT program. We collected tinnitus psychoacoustic features and gathered the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) before and after TRT. We also used a multi-featured paradigm, including frequency, intensity, duration, location and silent gap deviants, to elicit MMN response before and after TRT. Data were analyzed retrospectively.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: The study involved 26 chronic tinnitus patients.\nRESULTS: Post-TRT measurements showed that MMN amplitudes significantly increased for all deviant conditions (p ≤ .03). However, we did not find a significant difference in MMN latencies for all deviant conditions (p ≥ .13). The THI scores of the patients significantly decreased following the TRT program (\np\n< 0.001). Our results reveal improved subjective tinnitus perception following the TRT program.\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that TRT might be a viable alternative in tinnitus management. The greater MMN amplitudes and improved subjective tinnitus perception raise the possibility that MMN can be a useful tool in tinnitus research and tinnitus patient follow-up.\nPMID:\n39037049\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2378800",

Exclusions were applied for acquired hearing loss or auditory neuropathy.\nRESULTS: Ears with hearing loss that passed screening had significantly lower TEOAE response levels compared to ears with normal hearing. Noise levels, test times, and number of sweeps were also lower. Most of these ears had mild hearing loss. Logistic regression results showed that high-frequency TEOAE response level is the best predictor of hearing loss. A multivariate \"logit\" score calculated from the regression was the best indicator for separating ears with hearing loss from ears with normal hearing.\nCONCLUSIONS: TEOAE response levels or an algorithm which incorporates logit scores should be considered as a minimum passing criterion to increase the sensitivity of the TEOAE screening.\nPMID:\n39033358\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2378808",

Participants completed evaluation questionnaires after their appointment. Statistical and thematic analyses were used to examine the rating scale and open response elements of the questionnaires respectively.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 45 families participated, 24 randomised to MHEfC and 21 to standard care.\nRESULTS: Use of MHEfC increased the appointment duration by 8.2 minutes (95% CI 4.1 to 14.2 minutes), which was acceptable to parents (96%) and audiologists (67%). It promoted conversation around 'behavioural and communication tactics', 'specific listening situations' and 'listening effort' at the expense of 'anatomy/physiology/aetiology'. MHEfC positively impacted the discussion of test results (54%); ease of finding joint solutions to problems (71%); and the nature of issues and management options discussed (54%). Parental satisfaction with discussion was high on both pathways, so some parents and audiologists questioned MHEfC necessity and recommended targeted use in future.\nCONCLUSIONS: MHEfC was acceptable to children (70%) and parents (86%).

The subject presented with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and diplacusis a day after onset. Testing involved detailed interview, standard audiometry, detailed inter-octave audiometry, and measurement of detailed psychophysical frequency tuning curves during a two day recovery period.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: One male aged in his thirties with otherwise normal hearing.\nRESULTS: Although standard audiometry was within normal limits, detailed inter-octave audiometry and psychophysical frequency tuning curves were consistent with a punctate unilateral intra-cochlear lesion that resolved over a period of three days.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of such a frequency-specific audiometric shift and diplacusis after sildenafil, and is not consistent with previous reports of direct ototoxic pharmacological effects. We propose that the lesion was most likely caused by a cochlear bleed, and may have been due to physical exertion rather than a direct pharmaceutical effect.

Existing interventions lack effectiveness and are typically not based on a theoretically driven, comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing infant hearing aid use. The present study is the first to address this gap in understanding.\nDESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: A 55-item online survey based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was completed by 56 parents of 0-3-year-old hearing aid users.\nRESULTS: Participants reported a wide range of barriers across TDF domains, which were associated with parent-reported hearing aid use and more pronounced in parents of lower hearing aid users. The most strongly reported domains across participants were \"emotion\" (e.g. feelings of worry when using hearing aids), \"beliefs about capabilities\" (e.g. belief in ability to use hearing aids consistently), and \"environmental context and resources\" (e.g. child removing hearing aids).\nCONCLUSIONS: Parents report a wider range of barriers to infant hearing aid use than existing investigations suggest and current interventions address.

To better serve individuals with communication difficulties, precision diagnostics are needed to characterize individuals' auditory perceptual and cognitive abilities beyond pure tone thresholds. These abilities can be heterogenous across individuals within the same population. The goal of the present study is to consider the suprathreshold variability and develop characteristic profiles for older adults with normal hearing (ONH) and with hearing loss (OHL). Auditory perceptual and cognitive abilities were tested on ONH (\nn\n= 20) and OHL (\nn\n= 20) on an abbreviated test battery using portable automated rapid testing. Using cluster analyses, three main profiles were revealed for each group, showing differences in auditory perceptual and cognitive abilities despite similar audiometric thresholds. Analysis of variance showed that ONH profiles differed in spatial release from masking, speech-in-babble testing, cognition, tone-in-noise, and binaural temporal processing abilities. The OHL profiles differed in spatial release from masking, speech-in-babble testing, cognition, and tolerance to background noise performance. Correlation analyses showed significant relationships between auditory and cognitive abilities in both groups. This study showed that auditory perceptual and cognitive deficits can be present to varying degrees in the presence of audiometrically normal hearing and among listeners with similar degrees of hearing loss. The results of this study inform the need for taking individual differences into consideration and developing targeted intervention options beyond pure tone thresholds and speech testing.\nPMID:\n39099537\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241263485",

Reports of hearing-impaired people indicate that strenuous listening situations occurring throughout the day lead to feelings of fatigue at the end of the day. The aim of the present study was to develop a suitable test sequence to evoke and measure listening effort (LE) and listening-related fatigue (LRF), and, to evaluate the influence of hearing aid use on both dimensions in mild to moderately hearing-impaired participants. The chosen approach aims to reconstruct a representative acoustic day (Time Compressed Acoustic Day [TCAD]) by means of an eight-part hearing-test sequence with a total duration of approximately 2½ h. For this purpose, the hearing test sequence combined four different listening tasks with five different acoustic scenarios and was presented to the 20 test subjects using virtual acoustics in an open field measurement in aided and unaided conditions. Besides subjective ratings of LE and LRF, behavioral measures (response accuracy, reaction times), and an attention test (d2-R) were performed prior to and after the TCAD. Furthermore, stress hormones were evaluated by taking salivary samples. Subjective ratings of LRF increased throughout the test sequence. This effect was observed to be higher when testing unaided. In three of the eight listening tests, the aided condition led to significantly faster reaction times/response accuracies than in the unaided condition. In the d2-R test, an interaction in processing speed between time (pre- vs. post-TCAD) and provision (unaided vs. aided) was found suggesting an influence of hearing aid provision on LRF. A comparison of the averaged subjective ratings at the beginning and end of the TCAD shows a significant increase in LRF for both conditions. At the end of the TCAD, subjective fatigue was significantly lower when wearing hearing aids. The analysis of stress hormones did not reveal significant effects.\nPMID:\n39095047\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241265199",

For instance, at receptions people often stand while engaging in conversation. It is known that listening and postural control are associated with each other. Previous studies focused on the interplay of listening and postural control when the speech identification task had rather high cognitive control demands. This study aimed to determine whether listening and postural control interact when the speech identification task requires minimal cognitive control, i.e., when words are presented without background noise, or a large memory load. This study included 22 young adults, 27 middle-aged adults, and 21 older adults. Participants performed a speech identification task (auditory single task), a postural control task (posture single task) and combined postural control and speech identification tasks (dual task) to assess the effects of multitasking. The difficulty levels of the listening and postural control tasks were manipulated by altering the level of the words (25 or 30 dB SPL) and the mobility of the platform (stable or moving). The sound level was increased for adults with a hearing impairment. In the dual-task, listening performance decreased, especially for middle-aged and older adults, while postural control improved. These results suggest that even when cognitive control demands for listening are minimal, interaction with postural control occurs. Correlational analysis revealed that hearing loss was a better predictor than age of speech identification and postural control.\nPMID:\n39053897\n| PMC:\nPMC11282555\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260621",

We observed a positive peak followed by a wide negative trough, with the latter being most evident in early epochs. We argue that the overall response morphology captures the effects of two simultaneous, but independent, response mechanisms that are both activated at the stimulus onset: one being the obligatory response to a sound stimulus by the auditory system, and the other being a neural suppression effect induced by the arousal system. Because the two effects behave differently with repeated epochs, it is possible to mathematically separate them and use fNIRS to study factors that affect the development and activation of the arousal system in infants. The results also imply that standard fNIRS analysis techniques need to be adjusted to take into account the possibilities of multiple simultaneous brain systems being activated and that the response to a stimulus is not necessarily stationary.\nPMID:\n39053892\n| PMC:\nPMC11282554\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241258056",

The purpose of this study was the development of a novel speech-recognition test that combines concepts of different speech-recognition tests to reduce training effects and allows for a large set of speech material. The new test consists of four different words per trial in a meaningful construct with a fixed structure, the so-called phrases. Various free databases were used to select the words and to determine their frequency. Highly frequent nouns were grouped into thematic categories and combined with related adjectives and infinitives. After discarding inappropriate and unnatural combinations, and eliminating duplications of (sub-)phrases, a total number of 772 phrases remained. Subsequently, the phrases were synthesized using a text-to-speech system. The synthesis significantly reduces the effort compared to recordings with a real speaker. After excluding outliers, measured speech-recognition scores for the phrases with 31 normal-hearing participants at fixed signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) revealed speech-recognition thresholds (SRT) for each phrase varying up to 4 dB. The median SRT was -9.1 dB SNR and thus comparable to existing sentence tests. The psychometric function's slope of 15 percentage points per dB is also comparable and enables efficient use in audiology. Summarizing, the principle of creating speech material in a modular system has many potential applications.\nPMID:\n39051703\n| PMC:\nPMC11273571\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241261490",

These individual differences have been reported to be associated with a range of auditory and cognitive abilities. The present study addresses the association between SiN processing and the individual susceptibility of short-term memory to auditory distraction (i.e., the irrelevant sound effect [ISE]). In a sample of 67 young adult participants with normal audiometric thresholds, we measured speech recognition performance in a spatial listening task with two interfering talkers (speech-in-speech identification), audiometric thresholds, binaural sensitivity to the temporal fine structure (interaural phase differences [IPD]), serial memory with and without interfering talkers, and self-reported noise sensitivity. Speech-in-speech processing was not significantly associated with the ISE. The most important predictors of high speech-in-speech recognition performance were a large short-term memory span, low IPD thresholds, bilaterally symmetrical audiometric thresholds, and low individual noise sensitivity. Surprisingly, the susceptibility of short-term memory to irrelevant sound accounted for a substantially smaller amount of variance in speech-in-speech processing than the nondisrupted short-term memory capacity. The data confirm the role of binaural sensitivity to the temporal fine structure, although its association to SiN recognition was weaker than in some previous studies. The inverse association between self-reported noise sensitivity and SiN processing deserves further investigation.\nPMID:\n39051688\n| PMC:\nPMC11273587\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241262517",

For almost as many years, clinicians and researchers have sought ways to distill the volume and complexity of information on the audiogram. Commonly used approaches have made use of pure-tone averages (PTAs) for various frequency ranges with the PTA for 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (PTA4) being the most widely used for the categorization of hearing loss severity. Here, a three-digit triad is proposed as a single-number summary of not only the severity, but also the configuration and bilateral symmetry of the hearing loss. Each digit in the triad ranges from 0 to 9, increasing as the level of the pure-tone hearing threshold level (HTL) increases from a range of optimal hearing (< 10 dB Hearing Level; HL) to complete hearing loss (≥ 90 dB HL). Each digit also represents a different frequency region of the audiogram proceeding from left to right as: (Low, L) PTA for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz; (Center, C) PTA for 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz; and (High, H) HTL at 8000 Hz. This LCH Triad audiogram-classification system is evaluated using a large United States (U.S.) national dataset (N = 8,795) from adults 20 to 80 + years of age and two large clinical datasets totaling 8,254 adults covering a similar age range. Its ability to capture variations in hearing function was found to be superior to that of the widely used PTA4.\nPMID:\n38870447\n| PMC:\nPMC11179497\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260041",

However, its validity has been a subject of debate, as previous studies noted differences between hearing thresholds measured using conventional and in-situ audiometry. The differences were particularly notable for open-fit hearing aids, attributed to low-frequency leakage caused by the vent. Here, in-situ audiometry was investigated for six receiver-in-canal hearing aids from different manufacturers through three experiments. In Experiment I, the hearing aid gain was measured to investigate whether corrections were implemented to the prescribed target gain. In Experiment II, the in-situ stimuli were recorded to investigate if corrections were directly incorporated to the delivered in-situ stimulus. Finally, in Experiment III, hearing thresholds using in-situ and conventional audiometry were measured with real patients wearing open-fit hearing aids. Results indicated that (1) the hearing aid gain remained unaffected when measured with in-situ or conventional audiometry for all open-fit measurements, (2) the in-situ stimuli were adjusted for up to 30 dB at frequencies below 1000 Hz for all open-fit hearing aids except one, which also recommends the use of closed domes for all in-situ measurements, and (3) the mean interparticipant threshold difference fell within 5 dB for frequencies between 250 and 6000 Hz. The results clearly indicated that modern measured in-situ thresholds align (within 5 dB) with conventional thresholds measured, indicating the potential of in-situ audiometry for remote hearing care.\nPMID:\n38835268\n| PMC:\nPMC11155351\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241259704",

One possible source of benefit is ANC's ability to reduce the sound level of the direct (i.e., vent-transmitted) path. This reduction lowers the \"floor\" imposed by the direct path, thereby allowing any increases to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) created in the amplified path to be \"realized\" at the eardrum. Here we used a modeling approach to estimate this benefit. We compared pairs of simulated hearing aids that differ only in terms of their ability to provide ANC and computed intelligibility metrics on their outputs. The difference in metric scores between simulated devices is termed the \"ANC Benefit.\" These simulations show that ANC Benefit increases as (1) the environmental sound level increases, (2) the ability of the hearing aid to improve SNR increases, (3) the strength of the ANC increases, and (4) the hearing loss severity decreases. The predicted size of the ANC Benefit can be substantial. For a moderate hearing loss, the model predicts improvement in intelligibility metrics of >30% when environments are moderately loud (>70 dB SPL) and devices are moderately capable of increasing SNR (by >4 dB). It appears that ANC can be a critical ingredient in hearing devices that attempt to improve SNR in loud environments. ANC will become more and more important as advanced SNR-improving algorithms (e.g., artificial intelligence speech enhancement) are included in hearing devices.\nPMID:\n38831646\n| PMC:\nPMC11149449\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260029",

The data were retrieved from a total of 52 children with MBHL and 30 children with normal hearing (NH). The association between demographical, audiological factors and language outcomes was examined. Analyses of variance were conducted to compare the language abilities of HA users, non-HA users, and their NH peers. Furthermore, regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of language outcomes. Aided better ear pure-tone average (BEPTA) was significantly correlated with language comprehension scores. Among children with MBHL, those who used HA outperformed the ones who did not use HA across all linguistic domains. The language skills of children with MBHL were comparable to those of their peers with NH. The degree of improvement in audibility in terms of aided BEPTA was a significant predictor of language comprehension. It is noteworthy that 50% of the parents expressed reluctance regarding HA use for their children with MBHL. The findings highlight the positive impact of HA usage on language development in this population. Professionals may therefore consider HAs as a viable treatment option for children with MBHL, especially when there is a potential risk of language delay due to hearing loss. It was observed that 25% of the children with MBHL had late-onset hearing loss. Consequently, the implementation of preschool screening or a listening performance checklist is recommended to facilitate early detection.\nPMID:\n38773778\n| PMC:\nPMC11113073\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241256721",

Progressing beyond these unnatural stimuli, brainstem responses to continuous speech presented via earphones have been recently detected using linear temporal response functions (TRFs). Here, we extend earlier studies by measuring subcortical responses to continuous speech presented in the sound-field, and assess the amount of data needed to estimate brainstem TRFs. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 24 normal hearing participants while they listened to clicks and stories presented via earphones and loudspeakers. Subcortical TRFs were computed after accounting for non-linear processing in the auditory periphery by either stimulus rectification or an auditory nerve model. Our results demonstrated that subcortical responses to continuous speech could be reliably measured in the sound-field. TRFs estimated using auditory nerve models outperformed simple rectification, and 16 minutes of data was sufficient for the TRFs of all participants to show clear wave V peaks for both earphones and sound-field stimuli. Subcortical TRFs to continuous speech were highly consistent in both earphone and sound-field conditions, and with click ABRs. However, sound-field TRFs required slightly more data (16 minutes) to achieve clear wave V peaks compared to earphone TRFs (12 minutes), possibly due to effects of room acoustics. By investigating subcortical responses to sound-field speech stimuli, this study lays the groundwork for bringing objective hearing assessment closer to real-life conditions, which may lead to improved hearing evaluations and smart hearing technologies.\nPMID:\n38738341\n| PMC:\nPMC11092544\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246596",

Both age and noise exposure contribute to synaptopathy in animal models, indicating that it may be a common type of auditory dysfunction in humans. Temporal bone and auditory physiological data suggest that age and occupational/military noise exposure also lead to synaptopathy in humans. The predicted perceptual consequences of synaptopathy include tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. However, confirming the perceptual impacts of this form of cochlear deafferentation presents a particular challenge because synaptopathy can only be confirmed through post-mortem temporal bone analysis and auditory perception is difficult to evaluate in animals. Animal data suggest that deafferentation leads to increased central gain, signs of tinnitus and abnormal loudness perception, and deficits in temporal processing and signal-in-noise detection. If equivalent changes occur in humans following deafferentation, this would be expected to increase the likelihood of developing tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. Physiological data from humans is consistent with the hypothesis that deafferentation is associated with increased central gain and a greater likelihood of tinnitus perception, while human data on the relationship between deafferentation and hyperacusis is extremely limited. Many human studies have investigated the relationship between physiological correlates of deafferentation and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception, with mixed findings. A non-linear relationship between deafferentation and speech perception may have contributed to the mixed results. When differences in sample characteristics and study measurements are considered, the findings may be more consistent.\nPMID:\n38738337\n| PMC:\nPMC11092548\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241239541",

A total of 4,589 SM undergoing annual audiometric surveillance were prospectively recruited to complete the THS tinnitus subscale (THS-T). A subset of 1,304 participants also completed the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). The original 5-point response scale of the THS (THS-T\n16\n) was modified to an 11-point scale (THS-T\n40\n) for some participants, to align with the response scale of the TFI. Age, sex, hearing loss, and self-reported tinnitus bother were also recorded. The THS-T was relatively insensitive to hearing, but self-reported bothersome tinnitus was significantly associated with the THS-T\n40\nscore. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine cutoff scores on the THS-T that aligned with recommended cutoff values for clinical intervention on the TFI. A cutoff of 9 on the THS-T\n40\naligns with a TFI cutoff of 25, indicating a patient may need intervention for tinnitus. A cutoff of 15 aligns with a TFI cutoff of 50, indicating that more aggressive intervention for tinnitus is warranted. The THS-T is a viable tool to identify patients with tinnitus complaints warranting clinical evaluation for use by hearing conservation programs and primary care clinics.

A promising method is electrocochleography (ECochG). Within this project the relations between intracochlear ECochG recordings, position of the recording contact in the cochlea with respect to anatomy and frequency and preservation of residual hearing were investigated. The aim was to better understand the changes in ECochG signals and whether these are due to the electrode position in the cochlea or to trauma generated during insertion. During and after insertion of hearing preservation electrodes, intraoperative ECochG recordings were performed using the CI electrode (MED-EL). During insertion, the recordings were performed at discrete insertion steps on electrode contact 1. After insertion as well as postoperatively the recordings were performed at different electrode contacts. The electrode location in the cochlea during insertion was estimated by mathematical models using preoperative clinical imaging, the postoperative location was measured using postoperative clinical imaging. The recordings were analyzed from six adult CI recipients. In the four patients with good residual hearing in the low frequencies the signal amplitude rose with largest amplitudes being recorded closest to the generators of the stimulation frequency, while in both cases with severe pantonal hearing losses the amplitude initially rose and then dropped. This might be due to various reasons as discussed in the following. Our results indicate that this approach can provide valuable information for the interpretation of intracochlearly recorded ECochG signals.\nPMID:\n38717441\n| PMC:\nPMC11080744\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241248973",

Our findings show that the traceability of each procedure can be secured, satisfying the uncertainty requirement and being sufficiently smaller than the permissible deviation from the audiometer requirement. To guarantee the objectivity and reliability of hearing tests and maintain low uncertainty, close cooperation and mutual understanding between the metrology field and the medical community are necessary.\nPMID:\n39054854\n| PMC:\nPMC11273182\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00227",

However, although relatively new, they are not well-established. In this article, we review DTx technologies in hearing research fields, focusing on three categories: prevention and diagnosis, aid (assistance), and cure (digital medicine). We observe that most DTx systems require interactions with users (or patients) without the direct support of clinical professionals to obtain or collect medical evidence; this makes training (or education) features crucial to the therapy's success. In this view, this article discusses the education or training functions of the current DTx and their contribution and purposes.

Epub 2024 Jul 2.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Localization of a sound source in the horizontal plane depends on the listener's interaural comparison of arrival time and level. Hearing loss (HL) can reduce access to these binaural cues, possibly disrupting the localization and memory of spatial information. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the horizontal sound localization performance and the spatial short-term memory in listeners with actual and simulated HL.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventeen listeners with bilateral symmetric HL and 17 listeners with normal hearing (NH) participated in the study. The hearing thresholds of NH listeners were elevated by a spectrally shaped masking noise for the simulations of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) and bilateral hearing loss (BHL). The localization accuracy and errors as well as the spatial short-term memory span were measured in the free field using a set of 11 loudspeakers arrayed over a 150° arc.\nRESULTS: The localization abilities and spatial short-term memory span did not significantly differ between actual BHL listeners and BHL-simulated NH listeners. Overall, the localization performance with the UHL simulation was approximately twofold worse than that with the BHL simulation, and the hearing asymmetry led to a detrimental effect on spatial memory. The mean localization score as a function of stimulus location in the UHL simulation was less than 30% even for the front (0° azimuth) stimuli and much worse on the side closer to the simulated ear. In the UHL simulation, the localization responses were biased toward the side of the intact ear even when sounds were coming from the front.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hearing asymmetry induced by the UHL simulation substantially disrupted the localization performance and recall abilities of spatial positions encoded and stored in the memory, due to fewer chances to learn strategies to improve localization. The marked effect of hearing asymmetry on sound localization highlights the need for clinical assessments of spatial hearing in addition to conventional hearing tests.\nPMID:\n38946331\n| PMC:\nPMC11273189\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00206",

Patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUVP) show a systematic SVV bias toward the affected side, whichever the side of line orientation. Whether SVV estimates are symmetrical has not been investigated.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included 10 patients with AUVP (vestibular neuritis) and 10 with BPPV (posterior semicircular canal). SVV measurements were made at two preset angles of line orientation (15° and 30°) toward the ipsilateral and contralateral sides, relative to the affected side.\nRESULTS: The results showed asymmetrical SVV estimates in the AUVP group, with significantly greater SVV errors for ipsilateral than contralateral line orientation, as well as for the preset angle of 30° compared to 15°. SVV estimates were significantly lower in patients with BPPV who also exhibited SVV asymmetry. SVV estimates remained unchanged just after the maneuver and were normalized some days later or after supplementary maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: SVV asymmetry should be routinely considered in the clinic. We recommend individually assessing ipsilateral and contralateral SVV and using at least two preset angles. This allows for a better assessment and diagnosis of otolith organ imbalance that can trigger chronic instability and dizziness. The contribution of neck afferents related to head position in space seems to be the main source of SVV asymmetry.\nPMID:\n38946330\n| PMC:\nPMC11273183\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00346",

Synthetic materials are unsatisfactory for MO because of the risk of rejection and extrusion. We investigated the safety and effectiveness of bone allografts for post-mastoidectomy MO.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent mastoidectomy with MO between January 2013 and January 2021. In the MO group, bone allografts were additionally used to fill the residual mastoid cavity. In the canal wall down (CWD) group, all patients underwent CWD mastoidectomy with use of additional inferiorly based mucoperiosteal flaps.\nRESULTS: The study included the MO group (23 ears) and the CWD group (53 ears). In the MO group, compared with the preoperative status, we observed a decrease in the tendency of the air-bone gap postoperatively. Compared with the CWD group, the total complication rate showed a decreasing tendency in the MO group.\nCONCLUSIONS: No patient showed post-MO shrinkage of the grafted bone allograft or otorrhea.

Intellectual ability is a crucial outcome determinant of a cochlear implant. The social quotient (SQ) is an indirect predictor of intellectual capacity and social skills. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of the SQ on children with additional needs who received cochlear implants. Subjects and.\nMETHODS: This study included 24 patients with diagnosed developmental delays and syndromes, who demonstrated SQ scores of <70. Preoperative social skills were evaluated using the SQ. All patients underwent cochlear implantation (CI) surgery before 7 years of age. Outcomes were evaluated using the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) and Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) scores. Data were collected through a retrospective chart review.\nRESULTS: Children were categorized into three groups based on their SQ. There were no correlations between the preoperative SQ and IT-MAIS or CAP scores at 2 and 5 years of follow-up postoperatively. The CI outcomes of children with low SQ (<70) differed from those with normal development (SQ>70). In the low-SQ group, inner ear anomalies were observed in 10 (41.7%) patients. Although not statistically significant, these children exhibited a trend of lower average outcomes than children without inner ear anomalies.\nCONCLUSIONS: CI outcomes in children with additional needs positively affected auditory performance. Postoperative auditory and language skills tended to improve slowly in children with additional needs and a lower SQ. Over time, development gradually became more comparable to the other groups of children. However, this improvement was less than that observed in children without additional needs. Our findings support CI for children with additional needs as part of long-term auditory rehabilitation following surgery.\nPMID:\n38695056\n| PMC:\nPMC11065552\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00101",

Twenty-eight recently published intracochlear ECoG articles were thoroughly reviewed to investigate the prognostic utility of intraoperative ECoG monitoring to assess hearing preservation, and the clinical applicability of postoperative ECoG for estimating audiometric thresholds and monitoring longitudinal changes in residual acoustic hearing in patients with EAS. Intraoperative ECoG studies have focused on monitoring the changes in the cochlear microphonics (CM) amplitudes during and after electrode insertion. Mixed results have been reported regarding the relationship between changes in CM amplitude in the operating room and changes in hearing thresholds after surgery. Postoperative ECoG studies have shown that CM and auditory nerve neurophonics thresholds correlate significantly with behavioral thresholds. ECoG thresholds sensitively detect changes as residual acoustic hearing decreases over time in some CI users. This indicates its potential clinical value for monitoring the post-implantation status of the peripheral auditory system. Intracochlear ECoG can provide real-time intraoperative feedback and monitor postoperative hearing preservation in a growing population of CI users.\nPMID:\n38695055\n| PMC:\nPMC11065546\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00129",

Considering the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of SNHL, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized knowledge on its genomic architecture. Nonetheless, the conventional application of panel and exome sequencing in real-world practice is being challenged by the emerging need to explore the diagnostic capability of whole-genome sequencing, which enables the detection of both noncoding and structural variations. Small molecules and gene therapies represent good examples of how breakthroughs in genetic understanding can be translated into targeted therapies for SNHL. For example, targeted small molecules have been used to ameliorate autoinflammatory hearing loss caused by gain-of-function variants of NLRP3 and inner ear proteinopathy with OSBPL2 variants underlying dysfunctional autophagy. Strikingly, the successful outcomes of the first-in-human trial of OTOF gene therapy highlighted its potential in the treatment of various forms of genetic hearing loss. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies are currently being developed for site-specific genome editing to treat human genetic disorders.

Because of advances in genetic testing, imaging resolution, CI technology, post-implant rehabilitation, and other factors, issues related to CI surgery in children continue to evolve. Such factors have led to changes in candidacy guidelines, vaccine requirements, and lowering of age requirement for surgery.

Epub 2024 Apr 30.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The temporal structure of sound, characterized by regular patterns, plays a crucial role in optimizing the processing of auditory information. The meter, representing a well-organized sequence of evenly spaced beats in music, exhibits a hierarchical arrangement, with stronger beats occupying higher metrical positions. Moreover, the meter has been shown to influence behavioral and neural processing, particularly the N1, P2, and mismatch negativity components. However, the role of the P1 component in the context of metrical hierarchy remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component and compare the responses between musicians and non-musicians.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty participants (15 musicians and 15 non-musicians) were enrolled in the study. Auditory stimuli consisted of a synthesized speech syllable presented together with a repeating series of four tones, establishing a quadruple meter. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to measure the P1 component.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that metrical position had a significant effect on P1 amplitude, with the strongest beat showing the lowest amplitude. This contrasts with previous findings, in which enhanced P1 responses were typically observed at on-the-beat positions. The reduced P1 response on the strong beat can be interpreted within the framework of predictive coding and temporal prediction, where a higher predictability of pitch changes at the strong beat leads to a reduction in the P1 response. Furthermore, higher P1 amplitudes were observed in musicians compared to non-musicians, suggesting that musicians have enhanced sensory processing.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component, thereby enriching our understanding of auditory processing. The results suggest that predictive coding and temporal prediction play important roles in shaping sensory processing.

The purpose of this study was to validate a pediatric version of the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire (P-SHQ) for determining binaural hearing benefits and spatial hearing ability in children.\nMETHOD: We recruited parents and guardians of 68 children ages kindergarten through eighth grade to participate. Parents completed the P-SHQ, the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale-Parent version, and a demographic questionnaire. To determine the factor structure of the P-SHQ, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis and reliability was assessed by calculating correlation coefficients.\nRESULTS: Three factors emerged during factor analysis: Factor 1 = sound localization, Factor 2 = speech-in-noise perception, and Factor 3 = speech perception in quiet. The P-SHQ has good internal consistency reliability (α = .97), and high item-total correlations were found. The correlation between scores from the P-SHQ questionnaire and the SSQ-Spatial subscale questionnaire provides evidence for the construct validity of the P-SHQ.\nCONCLUSIONS: The P-SHQ is a reliable and valid questionnaire to assess spatial hearing ability in children. This quick-to-administer tool can be incorporated into audiological care to determine the spatial hearing skills of a child and assist in counseling, making it a valuable assessment for hearing health care professionals.\nPMID:\n39058953\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00009",

The specific objectives were to identify and report the test protocol used, identify the most common timeline of follow-up, and identify barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of the monitoring program.\nMETHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted across six electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. The scoping review method adhered to relevant guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and frameworks. The database search was carried out by two independent researchers, and studies were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nRESULTS: This scoping review identified 13 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study. Only one study reported findings from the perspective of ototoxicity monitoring. Another study explicitly mentioned that ototoxicity monitoring was a standard of care in their hospital. Only one study reported using the relevant guidelines for monitoring ototoxicity. Specialized tests such as high-frequency audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and vestibular tests were rarely used. Ototoxicity monitoring was influenced by awareness-related factors, technical factors, treatment-related factors, and organizational factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Research on ototoxicity monitoring programs is in its early stages, highlighting the need for standardized practices and multidisciplinary collaboration to enhance health care services for HNC patients. A standardized approach, improved awareness, and the incorporation of patient perspectives are crucial to enhancing ototoxicity monitoring in HNC patients.\nPMID:\n39052439\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00028",

Therefore, there is a need to investigate the postural control abilities and the ability to use sensory inputs in BPPV patients in different conditions.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the postural control performance of middle-aged adult BPPV patients in easy and difficult balance tasks, the effect of vestibular stimulation on the maintenance of balance, and the risk of falling, by posturographic evaluation in various conditions.\nMETHOD: A total of 26 patients diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV and 26 controls were included in the study. Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Vestibular Stimulation Test (VST), and fall risk assessment (FRA) were applied to the participants, respectively.\nRESULTS: Significant difference was observed in SOT medio-lateral (ML) plane in Conditions 2 and 5 (\np\n< .05). A significant difference was observed in the vestibular score in the SOT ML plane. No significant difference was observed in VST test scores (\np\n> .05). In the FRA test, a significant difference was observed in the energy and gain parameters in the anterio-posterior plane (\np\n< .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The current study examined postural control abilities of patients with BPPV in extensive external conditions and in both planes, using various sensory perturbations and stimulation. It was thought that while BPPV patients were in the active phase of the disease, their postural control skills in the ML plane decreased and they might be at risk of falling.\nPMID:\n39052352\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00263",

The hearing screening test was conducted using neckband earphones of a Bluetooth self-fitting device controlled by a smartphone app. The hearing screening tests were compared with the pure-tone audiometry in an audiometric booth. The amplification benefits of the self-fitting program-aided condition were evaluated and compared with those of unaided and preset program-aided conditions using the Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test (MHINT) and questionnaires.\nRESULTS: The pure-tone audiometry and hearing screening test results exhibited strong positive correlations at all test frequencies. In the environment with 90° noise, the sentence reception thresholds (SRTs) obtained for the self-fitting program-aided condition were significantly lower (\np\n= .032) than those obtained for the unaided condition, whereas no significant difference was observed between the preset program-aided and the unaided conditions. Moreover, the participants' satisfaction ratings for the devices were consistent with their MHINT results, with a strong positive correlation observed between satisfaction with self-fitting and user satisfaction in smartphone app's control, functionality, and learning. Younger participants were significantly more satisfied in learning to use the app.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bluetooth self-fitting devices can be used for simplified in situ hearing screenings with a sensitivity of 90.4%. The satisfaction ratings and improvements in SRTs indicate significant clinical benefits of the self-fitting program compared with the preset program, particularly in the 90°-noise environments.\nPMID:\n39024518\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00230",

The objective of this review was to systematically summarize and critically appraise existing evidence of the prognostic value of eCAP, eABR, and MRI for predicting post-cochlear implant (CI) speech perception outcomes in children, with a particular focus on the lesion site.\nMETHOD: The present systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 statement. Three electronic databases (ProQuest, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched with no restrictions on language, publication status, or year of publication. Studies on children identified with sensorineural hearing loss, auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder, cochlear nerve deficiency, or cochleovestibular nerve abnormalities reporting the relevance of eCAP, eABR, and/or MRI results to CI speech perception outcomes were included. The literature search yielded 1,887 publications. Methodological quality and strength of evidence were assessed by the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool, respectively.\nRESULTS: Of the 25 included studies, the relevance of eCAP, eABR, and/or MRI findings to post-CI speech perception outcomes was reported in 10, 11, and 11 studies, respectively. The studies were strongly in support of the prognostic value of eABR and MRI for CI outcomes. However, the relevance of eCAP findings to speech perception outcomes was uncertain.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the promising findings, caution is warranted in interpreting them due to the observational and retrospective design of the included studies, as well as the heterogeneity of the population and the limited control of confounding factors within these studies.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26169859.\nPMID:\n39018270\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00272",

Here, we show that there are significant differences in the scores that previous studies have reported for headphone and insert-phone transducers on the Words-in-Noise (WIN) Test, and discuss the possibility that the variations in high-frequency output that are allowable under the speech source specifications of American National Standards Institute S3.6 might be contributing to transducer-dependent differences in performance for the WIN and other tests that are presented through the auxiliary input channels of clinical audiometers.\nMETHOD: A literature review was conducted to identify articles that reported WIN Test results for both listeners with normal hearing and with hearing impairment and specified the type of transducer (insert or TDH-50) used for the data collection.\nRESULTS: Among the 19 included studies, participants with normal hearing using inserts exhibited systematically worse WIN Test scores compared to those using TDH-50 headphones, while participants with hearing loss showed comparable average scores across transducer types.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering transducer type when interpreting WIN Test outcomes, particularly when comparing to normative scores obtained from individuals with normal hearing. Although further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving differences in test performance across transducer types, these findings underscore the need for standardized test administration protocols and careful documentation of transducer type when administering speech-in-noise tests for clinical or research applications.\nPMID:\n38995872\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00055",

The participant and two researchers then met in a moderately noisy and reverberant food court at a local mall where the participant was asked to listen to a conversation between the two researchers. Participants rated the extent of their agreement with 10 positively worded statements specific to the conversation twice, once for each program. Participants then provided program-preference ratings for seven different aspects of a conversation during which the programs were switched back and forth by the researcher, so that participants were unaware of the condition to which they were listening.\nRESULTS: Real-world subjective ratings for all domains resulted in positive values on average for both programs. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the intervention algorithm had higher absolute ratings on five of the 10 criteria including understanding, clarity, focus, listening effort, and background noise. Ratings for preference between programs indicated a significant preference for the intervention algorithm for all seven criteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, the use of hearing aids with separate processing of sounds from the front and back hemisphere provided positive subjective ratings. However, following a group conversation with multiple conversation partners, improvements in the algorithm to account for the locations of interlocutors and the natural head turning of the hearing aid wearer that occurs during a conversation by adding and controlling multiple adaptive beams in the front hemisphere significantly influenced preference for all aspects rated.\nPMID:\n38984919\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00027",

The MSTB has been widely used by clinicians as a guide for cochlear implant (CI) candidacy evaluations and to document post-operative speech recognition performance. Due to changes in candidacy over the past 10 years, a revision to the MSTB was needed.\nMETHOD: In 2022, the Institute for Cochlear Implant Training (ICIT) recruited a panel of expert CI audiologists to update and revise the MSTB. This panel utilized a modified Delphi consensus process to revise the test battery and to improve its applicability considering recent changes in CI care.\nRESULTS: This resulted in the MTSB-Version 3 (MSTB-3), which includes test protocols for identifying not only traditional CI candidates but also possible candidates for electric-acoustic stimulation and patients with single-sided deafness and asymmetric hearing loss. The MSTB-3 provides information that supplements the earlier versions of the MSTB, such as recommendations of when to refer patients for a CI, recommended patient-reported outcome measures, considerations regarding the use of cognitive screeners, and sample report templates for clinical documentation of pre- and post-operative care. Electronic versions of test stimuli, along with all the materials described above, will be available to clinicians via the ICIT website (https://www.cochlearimplanttraining.com).\nCONCLUSION: The goal of the MSTB-3 is to be an evidence-based test battery that will facilitate a streamlined standard of care for adult CI candidates and recipients that will be widely used by CI clinicians.\nPMID:\n38980836\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00008",

This study aimed to address a research gap by investigating sources and levels of occupational stress in U.K. audiologists.\nMETHOD: A mixed-methods cross-sectional design and convenience sampling were utilized. The study used the Audiologist Occupational Stress Questionnaire (AOSQ) and an audiological working practices questionnaire. The study included 100 registered U.K. audiologists.\nRESULTS: The research revealed that over a third of participants reported experiencing moderate or higher levels of occupational stress. Pediatric audiologists and those with a high daily patient load reported significantly higher stress scores than other specialties and those seeing fewer patients per day. Identified sources of stress for U.K. audiologists included clinical demands and time constraints, staffing issues, leadership in the workplace, and equipment availability. Reported impacts of stress encompassed mental health issues, fatigue, social life disruptions, and physical health concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS: The research validated the use of the AOSQ in a U.K. setting, and the findings provided insights into the sources and levels of occupational stress experienced by U.K. audiologists, supporting existing research on occupational stress in audiologists in other countries. The identification of consistent stress themes across the literature underscores the need for targeted support and interventions to ensure the well-being of audiologists and empower them in maintaining their pivotal role in health care.\nPMID:\n38963786\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00024",

(2014), the current study aimed to expand the original study's findings-that SoTL was rarely published in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) literature from 2009 to 2013-to the subsequent 8-year period (2014-2021). The latter period was of particular relevance considering the dissolution of one American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)-affiliated publication and the addition of another non-ASHA-affiliated publication during that time.\nMETHOD: Ten peer-reviewed CSD journals and the articles published in them were identified via a survey of the literature that used narrowly defined criteria developed in collaboration with a librarian. Five trained CSD graduate student raters compared a definition of SoTL to article abstracts to determine whether each should have been categorized as SoTL. Part 1 of the study investigated an 8-year time span, Part 2 investigated the remaining nine journals in the subsequent 5 years, and Part 3 investigated publication rates of SoTL in\nTeaching and Learning in Communication Sciences & Disorders\n(\nTLCSD\n) alone.\nRESULTS: Part 1 of the study revealed that publication rates of SoTL were extremely low in the 10 surveyed CSD journals in the 8-year time span investigated. A similar and diminishing trend was found in Part 2. Even smaller percentages of journals were dedicated to SoTL. Part 3 confirmed that relatively large amounts of CSD-specific SoTL have been published in\nTLCSD\nsince its inception in 2017.\nCONCLUSIONS: As of 2021, SoTL articles continued to be uncommonly published in CSD journals. Until recently, scholarly teachers attempting to apply SoTL in the classroom had limited resources. Beginning in 2017,\nTLCSD\nhas provided an outlet for SoTL, whereas other CSD journals seem to have published less of it. Reform of publication, peer review, tenure, and promotion policies and procedures is called for so that SoTL might be included as a valid scientific endeavor.\nPMID:\n38963783\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00234",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Specific learning disorder (SLD) refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by problems with reading, writing, or mathematics that are not solely due to intellectual disabilities, sensory deficits, or other neurological or medical conditions. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the processing and organizing of information. Auditory and cognitive processing is affected in most children with SLD, although to a varying degree. However, it is still unclear whether there exists any relationship between auditory and cognitive processing disorders in children with SLD.\nMETHOD: We tested 1,259 children, of whom 77 were diagnosed as SLD and 30 age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) children were selected. Auditory processing abilities were assessed for auditory discrimination, pattern perception, closure, temporal processing, binaural integration, and separation using standardized tests and procedures. Cognitive processing was measured using working memory, short-term memory, and attention tasks.\nRESULTS: The test data of the TD children were taken as the norm. Based on the normative range, children with SLD were divided into those with auditory processing disorder (APD;\nn\n= 31) and those without APD (\nn\n= 46). A regression model highlighted a robust positive relationship between APD and cognitive processing, particularly pronounced in SLD with APD children. The results are discussed, supporting the information-processing theory of learning disability and highlighting a complex loop between auditory and cognitive deficits in children with SLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the critical role of both auditory and cognitive abilities in children with SLD. Tailoring the intervention to break the loop is recommended, which may improve learning abilities more effectively.\nPMID:\n38959167\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00001",

It is a powerful research tool but can be complex and challenging for beginners. Application of EMA in audiological research brings with it opportunities and challenges that differ from other research disciplines. This tutorial discusses important considerations when conducting EMA studies in hearing care. While more research is needed to develop specific guidelines for the various potential applications of EMA in hearing research, we hope this article can alert hearing researchers new to EMA to pitfalls when using EMA and help strengthen their study design. The current article elaborates study design details, such as choice of participants, representativeness of the study period for participants' lives, and balancing participant burden with data requirements. Mobile devices and sensors to collect objective data on the acoustic situation are reviewed alongside different possibilities for EMA setups ranging from online questionnaires paired with a timer to proprietary apps that also have access to parameters of a hearing device. In addition to considerations for survey design, a list of questionnaire items from previous studies is provided. For each item, an example and a list of references are given. EMA typically provides data sets that are rich but also challenging in that they are noisy, and there is often unequal amount of data between participants. After recommendations on how to check the data for compliance, reactivity, and careless responses, methods for statistical analysis on the individual level and on the group level are discussed including special methods for direct comparison of hearing device programs.\nPMID:\n38950171\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00249",

This study primarily aims to assess the hearing of wrestlers with bilateral cauliflower ears and determine their external ear canal (EEC) resonance frequencies. Our second aim is to evaluate their hearing quality, speech, and spatial perception.\nMETHOD: This study included 28 male wrestlers aged 18-35 years with bilateral cauliflower ears, as well as 27 male participants in the control group with no wrestling history. The participants' hearing thresholds were determined across the frequency range of 125-16000 Hz for air-conduction and 500-4000 Hz for bone conduction. EEC resonance frequencies were measured. Additionally, all participants completed the Turkish version of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) questionnaire.\nRESULTS: Wrestlers with cauliflower ears exhibited significantly higher hearing thresholds, particularly at frequencies above 4000 Hz (\np\n< .05). Analysis of EEC resonance showed a shift to higher frequencies in the second resonance peak of the right ear (\np\n< .001) and the first resonance peak of the left ear (\np\n= .045). SSQ scores revealed that wrestlers had higher spatial perception (\np\n= .046), hearing quality (\np\n= .004), and general scores (\np\n= .042) in comparison to the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blunt traumas in wrestlers, leading to cauliflower ear, can result in hearing loss. Moreover, deformities in the external ear affect the resonance frequencies of the EEC. Therefore, it is crucial to advocate for the use of ear protection equipment among wrestlers. When fitting hearing aids, attention should be given to changes in the EEC resonance frequency.\nPMID:\n38917152\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00277",

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up until June 30, 2023.\nRESULTS: Primary outcomes focused on complete resolution of vertiginous symptoms measured by either a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test. Secondary outcomes included conversion of a positive DH test to a negative DH test exclusively looking at positional nystagmus and assessment of side effects (cervical/back pain, posttreatment dizziness, and nausea). Both outcomes were assessed within a maximum of 4-week follow-up. Following systematic search and review, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs;\np\n= .413) were found. The studies reported on the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared to three other specific RM: Semont, Li, and Gans maneuvers. Results revealed a low to very low certainty of evidence. With the primary outcomes, Epley maneuver was superior to Gans maneuver 24-hr posttreatment but not after 1 week. No significant differences were found between the remaining maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, evidence of low to very low certainty indicates that Epley maneuver is comparable with Semont, Gans, and Li maneuvers for vertiginous symptoms in patients with P-BPPV.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing realistic auditory or somatosensory cues to spatial location would affect measures of vestibulo-ocular reflex gain in a rotary chair testing (RCT) context.\nMETHOD: This was a fully within-subject design. Thirty young adults age 18-30 years (16 men, 14 women by self-identification) completed sinusoidal harmonic acceleration testing in a rotary chair under five different conditions, each at three rotational frequencies (0.01, 0.08, and 0.32 Hz). We recorded gain as the ratio of the amplitude of eye movement to chair movement using standard clinical procedures. The five conditions consisted of two without spatial information (silence, tasking via headphones) and three with either auditory (refrigerator sound, tasking via speaker) or somatosensory (fan) information. Two of the conditions also included mental tasking (tasking via headphones, tasking via speaker) and differed only in terms of the spatial localizability of the verbal instructions. We used linear mixed-effects modeling to compare pairs of conditions, specifically examining the effects of the availability of spatial cues in the environment. This study was preregistered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2gqcf/).\nRESULTS: Results showed significant effects of frequency in all conditions (\np\n< .05), but the only pairs of conditions that were significantly different were those including tasking in one condition but not the other (e.g., tasking via headphones vs. silence). Post hoc equivalence testing showed that the lack of significance in the other comparisons could be confirmed as not meaningfully different.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the presence of externally localizable sensory information, whether auditory or somatosensory, does not affect measures of gain in RCT to any relevant degree. However, these findings also contribute to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that mental engagement (\"tasking\") does increase gain whether or not it is provided via localizable instructions.\nPMID:\n38896881\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00017",

The parameters of sound that may cause beneficial effects, however, are currently only theorized with limited data supporting their effectiveness. Residual inhibition is the temporary suppression or elimination of tinnitus that is usually observed following appropriate auditory stimulation. Our pilot study investigated the effects of a therapeutic acoustic stimulus that was individually customized to maximize residual inhibition of tinnitus and extend its duration to determine if there could be a sustained suppression of the tinnitus signal (i.e., reduced tinnitus loudness) and a reduction in the psychological and emotional reactions to tinnitus. This pilot study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate the feasibility of residual inhibition technique therapy through daily use of hearing aids and (2) to determine its effects by measuring reactionary changes in tinnitus with the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and perceptual changes in tinnitus loudness. A total of 20 adults (14 males, 6 females; mean age: 58 years, SD = 12.88) with chronic tinnitus were enrolled in a four-visit study that consisted of the following: (1) baseline visit and initiation of the intervention period, (2) a 1-month postintervention visit, (3) 2-month postintervention visit and initiation of a wash-out period, and (4) a 3-month visit to assess the wash-out period and any lasting effects of the intervention. The intervention consisted of fitting bilateral hearing aids and creating an individualized residual inhibition stimulus that was streamed via Bluetooth from a smartphone application to the hearing aids. The participants were instructed to wear the hearing aids and stream the residual inhibition stimulus all waking hours for the 2-month intervention period. During the wash-out period, the participants were instructed to use the hearing aids for amplification, but the residual inhibition stimulus was discontinued. At all visits, the participants completed the TFI, study-specific self-report measures to document perceptions of tinnitus, a psychoacoustic test battery consisting of tinnitus loudness and pitch matching, and a residual inhibition test battery consisting of minimum masking and minimum residual inhibition levels. At the end of the trial, participants were interviewed about the study experience and acceptability of the residual inhibition treatment technique. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted on the two main outcomes (TFI total score and tinnitus loudness) across all four visits. The results showed a significant main effect of visit on the TFI total score (\np\n< 0.0001). Specifically, the results indicated a significant reduction in TFI total scores from baseline to the 1-month post-intervention period, which remained stable across the 2-month post-intervention period and the wash-out period. The ANOVA results did not show a significant change in tinnitus loudness as a function of visit (\np\n= 0.480). The majority of the participants reported a positive experience with the study intervention at their exit interview. This pilot study demonstrated that residual inhibition as a sound therapy for tinnitus, specifically through the daily use of hearing aids, was feasible and acceptable to individuals suffering from chronic tinnitus. In addition, participants showed improvement in reactions to tinnitus as demonstrated by sustained reduction in TFI scores on average over the course of the treatment period. Achieving residual inhibition may also provide patients a feeling of control over their tinnitus, and this may have a synergistic effect in reducing the psychological and emotional distress associated with tinnitus. There was no significant reduction in long-term tinnitus loudness resulting from the residual inhibition treatment; however, the current pilot study may not have had sufficient power to detect such a change. The combination of tinnitus suppression and improved psychosocial/emotional reactions to tinnitus may result in a better quality of life in both the short and long term. A larger-scale study is needed to determine the validity of using residual inhibition as a clinical therapy option and to ascertain any effects on both perception and reactions to tinnitus.\nPMID:\n38370522\n| PMC:\nPMC10872653\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770153",

However, physical and biological constraints ensure that these signals are perceived slightly asynchronously. The brain only recognizes them as simultaneous when they occur within a period of time called the temporal binding window (TBW). Aging can prolong the TBW, leading to temporal uncertainty during multisensory integration. This effect might contribute to imbalance in the elderly but has not been examined with respect to vestibular inputs. Here, we compared the vestibular-related TBW in 13 younger and 12 older subjects undergoing 0.5 Hz sinusoidal rotations about the earth-vertical axis. An alternating dichotic auditory stimulus was presented at the same frequency but with the phase varied to determine the temporal range over which the two stimuli were perceived as simultaneous at least 75% of the time, defined as the TBW. The mean TBW among younger subjects was 286 ms (SEM ± 56 ms) and among older subjects was 560 ms (SEM ± 52 ms). TBW was related to vestibular sensitivity among younger but not older subjects, suggesting that a prolonged TBW could be a mechanism for imbalance in the elderly person independent of changes in peripheral vestibular function.\nPMID:\n38370520\n| PMC:\nPMC10872654\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770137",

We sought to understand tinnitus rehabilitation service needs and preferences among Veterans with bothersome tinnitus who use Veterans Affairs (VA) services. We conducted semistructured telephone interviews in 2019 with Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, who reported it as bothersome. Veterans were purposively sampled to represent national VA users, with and without comorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI), and who were or were not interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services. Qualitative data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Among 40 Veterans interviewed (32 men, 8 women; 50% with TBI), 72.5% endorsed being somewhat/very likely to be interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services while 27.5% were very/somewhat unlikely. Themes related to Veterans' interest in tinnitus rehabilitation services included barriers and facilitators to participation and preferences for receiving tinnitus services (e.g., individual vs. group-based; in-person vs. remote access). Our findings highlight factors that influence Veterans' reported need and preferences for, and readiness to engage in, rehabilitation services for tinnitus. Personalized or otherwise adaptable approaches to program delivery may help ensure maximal uptake among Veterans.\nPMID:\n38370519\n| PMC:\nPMC10872667\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770138",

Many speech-in-noise tests have been developed and used to varying degrees. However, multiple barriers have prevented speech-in-noise testing from being used widely in the clinic. The purpose of this article is to provide a resource to audiologists and other hearing health professionals who want to know (1) what tests are available for use, (2) the rationale behind specific tests, and (3) important considerations when selecting one or more tests to use clinically. In addition, data are presented for four speech-in-noise tests with the purpose of comparing outcomes as a function of age and hearing status. The four tests (QuickSIN, Words in Noise [WIN], Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences [LiSN-S], and Coordinate Response Measure [CRM]) were completed by 30 individuals from three groups: 10 young adults with normal hearing, 10 older adults with normal hearing, and 10 older adults with hearing loss. The results suggest that, despite significant differences in performance between groups, group overlap was present such that some individuals from one group performed similar to some individuals of other groups; therefore, individual performance was more important than associated group. When selecting an appropriate speech-in-noise test to use clinically, audiologists should carefully consider the purpose of their testing and the type of information they desire as an outcome.

It is analogous to ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. OCT has recently been introduced in auditory research to visualize the various structures of the ear with a minimally invasive operation. In addition, OCT can be used as a vibrometry system that is capable to detect sound-induced sub-nanometer vibrations of the middle and inner ear. OCT-vibrometry measures depth-resolved vibrations into the specimen, which overcomes several limitations of classical vibrometry techniques (e.g., single surface point measurements using laser interferometry). In this article, we illustrate how to visualize the anatomy and function of the middle and inner ear (the cochlea) in a gerbil model using recently developed spectral-domain OCT. Our results demonstrate that the largest clinical impact of OCT for otology is to visualize various pathologies and quantify sound conduction and processing in the individual peripheral human ear.\nPMID:\n38370517\n| PMC:\nPMC10872649\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770154",

Severe tinnitus can be associated with negative impacts on daily life. Veterans with severe tinnitus may also have greater difficulties in functional roles, including work. However, few studies have explicitly explored this relationship. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also prevalent among Veterans, is associated with tinnitus and can additionally impair work functioning. This quantitative investigation used a population-based survey to assess the relationship between tinnitus severity, measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the impact of tinnitus on work, measured using a composite score from the Tinnitus History Questionnaire, among a stratified random sample of VA healthcare-using Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, with and without comorbid TBI. Analyses were weighted to account for sampling design and Veteran non-response; multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Results indicated that for every 1-point increase in TFI score, there was an average 8% increase in the odds of reporting a high level of impact on work functioning (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.11). Veterans with a comorbid TBI diagnosis, compared with those without, were more likely to have high tinnitus-related impact on work functioning (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.85, 3.91), but the relationship between tinnitus severity and the impact of tinnitus on work functioning did not differ by TBI status.

However, the impaired sensory and/or cognitive mechanisms underlying these auditory difficulties are largely unknown. This work used a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological measures to explore how neural stimulus discrimination and processing speed contribute to impaired temporal processing in blast-exposed Veterans measured using the behavioral Gaps-in-Noise (GIN) Test. Results confirm previous findings that blast exposure can impact performance on the GIN and effect neural auditory discrimination, as measured using the P3 auditory event-related potential. Furthermore, analyses revealed correlations between GIN thresholds, P3 responses, and a measure of behavioral reaction time. Overall, this work illustrates that behavioral responses to the GIN are dependent on both auditory-specific bottom-up processing beginning with the neural activation of the cochlea and auditory brainstem as well as contributions from complex neural networks involved in processing speed and task-dependent target detection.\nPMID:\n38370515\n| PMC:\nPMC10872670\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770139",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Electrically evoked cortical auditory evoked potentials (ECAEPs) are central brain responses to auditory stimuli that correlate with post-operative cochlear implant (CI) hearing outcomes. They differ from electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) which are peripheral responses that can be elicited intraoperatively and may also predict CI hearing outcomes. It is not known to what degree ECAP and ECAEP responses are associated with each other. Such a correlation, if present, may allow for an earlier and more accurate prediction of post-operative hearing outcomes.\nDESIGN: This retrospective study involved 42 adult CI users. Threshold levels and amplitude growth function slopes of intraoperative ECAPs were compared to the latencies and peak-to-peak amplitudes of postoperative ECAEP responses at three different cochlear electrode array sites (apical, medial, and basal).\nRESULTS: A weak positive relationship was found between intraoperative ECAP thresholds and ECAEP N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitude (r=0.301, p=0.005). Time between ECAP and ECAEP measurements was weakly correlated with P1-N1 peak-to-peak amplitude (r=0.321, p=0.002) and ECAEP N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitude (r=0.340, p=0.001). ECAP amplitude growth function (AGF) slopes varied by electrode location (χ²=26.701, df = 2, p=0. 000002).\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intraoperative ECAP responses do not robustly predict postoperative ECAEP responses, providing caution against the use of ECAPs as a predictive tool for CI hearing outcomes.\nPMID:\n39084205\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000540576",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implantation remains challenging. There are several approaches to preserve residual hearing, but the configuration of the implant electrode array seems to play a major role. Lateral wall electrode arrays are seemingly more favorable in this context. To date, there are no experimental data available which correlate the spatial electrode position in the scala tympani with the extent of hearing preservation.\nMETHODS: Based on µCT imaging data, this study analyses the exact position of a pure- silicone electrode array inserted into the cochlea of four guinea pigs. Array position data were correlated with the extent of hearing loss after implantation, measured using auditory brainstem measurements in the frequency range of the area occupied by the electrode array area as well as apical to the array.\nRESULTS: The use of pure-silicone arrays without electrodes resulted in artifact-free, high-resolution µCT images that allowed precise determination of the arrays' positions within the scala tympani. The electrode arrays' locations ranged from peri-modiolar to an anti-modiolar. These revealed a correlation of a lower postoperative hearing loss with a higher spatial proximity to the lateral wall. This correlation was found in the low-frequency range only. A significant correlation between the interindividual differences in the diameter of the scala tympani and the postoperative hearing loss could not be observed.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the importance of the intra-cochlear electrode array's position for the preservation of residual hearing. The advantage of such an electrode array's position approximated to the lateral wall suggests, at least for this type of electrode array applied in the guinea pig, would be advantageous in the preservation of residual hearing for the apical part of the cochlea, beyond the area occupied by the electrode array.\nPMID:\n38981457\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000540266",

However, clear evidence is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine if sudden sensorineural hearing loss is associated with COVID-19 illness or its vaccine.\nMETHODS: Retrospective chart review of fifty randomly selected patients from three, 6-month time periods: \"pre-pandemic\", \"early pandemic\", and \"late pandemic\". Group comparisons were performed for demographics, comorbid conditions, audiologic history, audiometric data, speech reception thresholds, and word recognition.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were included in this study. A mean difference was observed in that the relative percentage of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) cases increased over time, corresponding to a relative decrease in conductive hearing loss cases. However, this change was not explained by proportional changes in sudden SNHL. Patients in the early pandemic time period were more likely to report tinnitus. Otherwise, the patient groups did not differ on demographic variables, hearing health history, hearing loss presentation, pure tone averages, speech reception thresholds, or word recognition performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proportion of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss did not change over time from the pre-pandemic period to the early or late pandemic phases. Despite a randomized sample, these findings do not support the hypothesis that COVID-19 illness or vaccine is associated with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38880092\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539791",

Individuals' auditory attention, working memory, and auditory processing skills were assessed in the study, and self-report questionnaires were used. The evaluation utilized the Sustained Auditory Attention Capacity Test (SAACT), Working Memory Scale (WMS), Filtered Words Test, Auditory Figured Ground Test (AFGT), and the Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS). Analyses were conducted, including group comparisons, correlation examinations, and receiver operating characteristic evaluations.\nRESULTS: There were significant differences in CHAPS total, attention, noise, quiet, and multiple inputs between groups. No significant differences were seen in CHAPS_ideal and CHAPS_auditory memory across groups. The study of SAACT and its subscores, WMS and its subscores, FWT, and AFGT revealed a significant difference between groups, caused by the poor performance of persons in the HL group compared to those in the NH group. The SAACT and its subscores correlated significantly with CHAPS_attention. The AUC calculation showed that The SAACT and CHAPS_attention distinguished persons with or without HL (p &lt; 0.05). WMS_STM and WMS_total correlated with CHAPS auditory memory subscale; however, WMS_VWM did not. AUC values for WMS and its subscores showed significant discrimination in identifying children with or without HL (p &lt; 0.05), whereas CHAPS_auditory memory did not (AUC = 0.665; p = 0.060). FWT and AFGT had a significant relationship with CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subscales. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests only correlated with AFGT. CHAPS_quite and CHAPS_ideal did not exhibit significant discriminative values (p &lt; 0.05) for identifying children with or without HL, while CHAPS_noise, CHAPS_multiple inputs, FWT, and AFGT did.\nCONCLUSION: The CHAPS_attention subscale could be a trustworthy instrument for assessing auditory attention in children with HL. However, the CHAPS_auditory memory subscale may not be suitable for testing working memory. While performance-based auditory processing tests showed improved discrimination, the CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subtests can still assess hearing-impaired auditory processing. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests may not evaluate auditory processing.\nPMID:\n38880084\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539570",

The preservation of auditory neuronal and sensory neural hearing cells has a positive impact on auditory perception after implantation. This study aimed to provide details on a semi-automated spiral ganglion neuronal cell counting method, developed using whole implanted gerbil cochlea acquisitions with light-sheet microscopy.\nMETHODS: Mongolian gerbils underwent right cochlear implantation with an electrode array whose silicone was loaded with dexamethasone or not and were euthanized 10 weeks after implantation. The cochleae were prepared according to a 29-day protocol, with the electrode array in place. Light-sheet microscopy was used for acquisition, and Imaris software was employed for three-dimensional analysis of the cochleas and semi-automatic quantification of spiral ganglion cells. The imaJ software was used for the manual quantification of these cells.\nRESULTS: Six cochleae were acquired by light-sheet microscopy, allowing good identification of cells. There was no significant difference between the mean number of spiral ganglion cells obtained by manual and semi-automatic counting (p = 0.25).\nCONCLUSION: Light-sheet microscopy provided complete visualization of the spiral ganglion and cell identification. The semi-automated counting method developed using Imaris software tools proved reliable and efficient and could be applied to a larger sample to assess post-cochlear implant cell damage and the efficacy of protective drugs delivered to the inner ear.\nPMID:\n38810615\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539569",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND: Many studies have shown increased academic problems in children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL). However, whether hearing devices can ameliorate the educational difficulties associated with UHL is not well studied. Therefore, the objective of the current systematic review was to answer the question: do nonsurgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, and/or cochlear implants improve academic outcomes in school-aged children and adolescents with UHL?\nMETHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://ClinicalTrials.gov\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to December 21, 2022. Published, peer-reviewed studies comparing academic outcomes in patients with UHL aged ≥5 and ≤19 years with and without hearing devices (nonsurgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, or cochlear implants) were included. Results of studies were qualitatively synthesized, and the risk of bias was evaluated with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 5,644 non-duplicate publications were identified by the search, and four studies were included for synthesis, every one of which was investigating nonsurgical amplification. One small, single-arm study demonstrated significant improvement in subjective classroom listening difficulties after a 3- to 4-month trial with a behind-the-ear hearing aid. The other three studies of nonsurgical amplification devices showed no benefit across multiple academic outcomes with FM systems and conventional and CROS-style hearing aids.\nDISCUSSION: The small sample sizes, heterogeneous and/or ill-defined study samples, and overall low quality of the available literature ultimately make it hard to draw definitive conclusions regarding nonsurgical amplification devices' effectiveness in improving academic outcomes in children with UHL. No articles were identified that studied cochlear implants or bone-anchored hearing aids. Further studies with high-quality study design, large sample sizes, and long-term follow-up are needed to answer this clinically important question.\nPMID:\n38810609\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539513",

The scores were assessed using the Percent Sentence Recognition Index (PSRI). The data were inferentially analysed using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests with a 95% confidence interval and 5% significance level (p &lt; 0.05).\nRESULTS: The mean age was 41.1 years, the mean duration of CI use was 11.4 years, and the mean hearing threshold was 29.7 ± 5.9 dBHL. Test performance, as determined by the PSRI, was MLV = 42.4 ± 17.9%; RSTS = 20.3 ± 14.3%; RSSS = 40.6 ± 20.7%. There was a significant difference identified for RSTS compared to MLV and RSSS.\nCONCLUSION: The way the stimulus is presented and the speed at which it is presented enable greater auditory speech recognition in CI users, thus favouring comprehension when the tests are applied in the MLV and RSSS modalities.\nPMID:\n38768568\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539298",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Otosclerosis is a bone disorder affecting the labyrinthine capsule that leads to conductive and occasionally sensorineural hearing loss. The etiology of otosclerosis remains unknown; factors such as infection, hormones, inflammation, genetics, and autoimmunity have been discussed. Treatment consists primarily of surgical stapes replacement and cochlear implantation. High-resolution computed tomography is routinely used to visualize bone pathology. In the present study, we used synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI) to examine otosclerosis plaques in a temporal bone for the first time. The primary aim was to study their three-dimensional (3D) outline, vascular interrelationships, and connections to the middle ear.\nMETHODS: A donated ear from a patient with otosclerosis who had undergone partial stapedectomy with the insertion of a stapes wire prosthesis was investigated using SR-PCI and compared with a control ear. Otosclerotic lesions were 3D rendered using the composite with shading technique. Scalar opacity and color mapping were adjusted to display volume properties with the removal of bones to enhance surfaces. Vascular bone channels were segmented, and the communications between lesions and the middle ear were established.\nRESULTS: Fenestral, cochlear, meatal, and vestibular lesions were outlined three-dimensionally. Vascular bone channels were found to be frequently connected to the middle ear mucosa, perilabyrinthine air spaces, and facial nerve vessels. Round window lesions partly embedded the cochlear aqueduct which was pathologically narrowed, while the inferior cochlear vein was significantly dilated in its proximal part.\nCONCLUSION: Otosclerotic/otospongiotic lesions were imaged for the first time using SR-PCI and 3D rendering. The presence of shunts and abnormal vascular connections to the labyrinth appeared to result in hyper-vascularization, overloading the venous system, and leading to sensorineural hearing loss. We speculate about possible local treatments to alleviate the impact of such critical lesions on the labyrinthine microcirculation.\nPMID:\n38763131\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539422",

The time course of the involved pathologies is still under investigation. Several studies have demonstrated an acute damage of the sensory tissue, but only few experiments investigated the degeneration of (type I) spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), representing the primary neurons in the auditory system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of SGN degeneration within a 7-day period after traumatic noise exposure starting immediately after trauma.\nMETHODS: Young adult normal hearing mice were noise exposed for 3 h with a broadband noise (5-20 kHz) at 115 dB SPL. Auditory threshold shift was measured by auditory brainstem recordings, and SGN densities were analyzed at different time points during the first week after acoustic trauma.\nRESULTS: Significant reduction of SGN densities was detected and is accompanied by a significant hearing loss. Degeneration starts within hours after the applied trauma, further progressing within days post-exposure.\nDISCUSSION: Early neurodegeneration in the auditory periphery seems to be induced by direct overstimulation of the auditory nerve fibers. SGN loss is supposed to be a result of inflammatory responses and neural deprivation, leading to permanent hearing loss and auditory processing deficits.\nPMID:\n38749408\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539359",

This variability may be related to brain changes associated with intact senses recruiting cortical areas from stimulation-deprived senses. Numerous studies have demonstrated such cross-modal reorganization in individuals with untreated hearing loss. How it is affected by regular use of hearing devices remains unclear, however. To shed light on this, the current study measured cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities in experienced CI users and normal-hearing controls.\nMETHODS: Using multichannel electroencephalography, we tested CI users who had used their devices for at least 12 months and closely matched controls (N = 2 × 13). Cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities - the N400 and late positive complex (LPC) components - were evoked using congruent and incongruent digit-triplet stimuli. The participants' task was to assess digit-triplet congruency by means of timed button presses. All measurements were performed in speech-shaped noise 15 dB above individually measured speech recognition thresholds. Three stimulus presentation modes were used: auditory-only, visual-only, and visual-then-auditory.\nRESULTS: The analyses revealed no group differences in the N400 and LPC responses. In terms of response times, the CI users were slower and differentially affected by the three stimulus presentation modes relative to the controls.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to normal-hearing controls, experienced CI users may need more time to comprehend speech in noise. Response times can serve as a proxy for speech comprehension by CI users.\nPMID:\n38679013\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538701",

A newer Fast method - Italian Fast Speech Reception Threshold 50 (IFastSRT50) - is performed by means of program software with a single list of bisyllabic words and noise intensity shifting.\nRESULTS: Means comparison between SRT50 Classic and IFastSRT50 shows a slight significant correlation (r = 0.263; p = 0.044) and a wide significant difference: SRT50 Classic = -2.763 dB (SD = 4.1) and IFastSRT50 = -7.803 dB (SD = 2.1) (p &lt; 0.0001).

The study encompassed the assessment of the clinical presentation, treatment, quality of life, and evolution after treatment of the identified individuals.\nRESULTS: During the study period, six patients, aged between 33 and 71 years, developed vestibular ototoxicity following the use of topical aminoglycoside drops due infection flares in chronic otitis media. All cases involved the use of gentamicin. Two cases were unilateral, and four were unilateral. The onset of symptoms occurred within one to four weeks of using the drops, resulting in all patients experiencing instability without vertigo attacks. After discontinuing the drops and undergoing vestibular rehabilitation, four patients experienced sequelae, with two patients (both with bilateral vestibular hypofunction) suffering significant impairment in their quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Vestibular ototoxicity due to the topical application of aminoglycosides during acute exacerbations of chronic otitis media is a rare occurrence. However, given its potential for severe consequences and the fact that we are still encountering patients with this condition, healthcare professionals should explore alternative antibacterial agents that offer similar efficacy.\nPMID:\n38588647\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538756",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nDysphagia is common in motor neurone disease (MND) and associated with negative health and psychosocial outcomes. Although largely considered a motor disease, a growing body of evidence suggests that MND can also affect the sensory system. As intact sensation is vital for safe swallowing, and sensory changes can influence the clinical management of dysphagia in people living with MND, this review evaluated and summarised the current evidence for sensory changes related to swallowing in MND. Of 3,481 articles originally identified, 29 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 20 studies reported sensory changes, which included laryngeal sensation, taste, gag reflex, cough reflex, tongue sensation, smell, palatal and pharyngeal sensation, silent aspiration, and undefined sensation of the swallowing mechanism. Sensory changes were either described as decreased (n = 16) or heightened (n = 4). In the remaining nine studies, sensory function was reported as unaffected. The presence of changes to sensory function related to swallowing in MND remains inconclusive, although an increasing number of studies report sensory changes in some sensory domains. Future research is needed to evaluate the prevalence of sensory changes in MND and how such changes may influence dysphagia and its management.\nPMID:\n39096334\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10742-x",

This prospective study was conducted in China with individuals who speak Mandarin. The DHI-CM was developed according to a five-stage process. 264 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and 187 healthy individuals completed the study. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's α and test-retest reliability. Differences between healthy participants and patients with OD were analyzed for instrument validity. Convergent and concurrent validity were assessed using the Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QoL) and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), respectively. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was used to assess content validity. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (EFA and CFA, respectively) were used to assess structural validity. The Cronbach's alpha was > 0.9 for the total score and every individual subscale. The Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficients were both > 0.8. The patients with OD showed significantly higher scores in the DHI-CM and its subscales than the healthy individuals. Significant correlations were found between most subscales of the DHI-CM and both the SWAL-QoL and FOIS. The CVI of the DHI-CM was 0.892 and ranged between 0.878 and 1.000 for the subscales. The EFA identified three components that explained 24.33%, 23.99%, and 22.73% of the variance, respectively. The scale showed good structural validity through CFA. Conclusions.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nFollowing the expansion of interdisciplinary communication among rehabilitative service providers, new techniques have been introduced for treating swallowing disorders. Kinesio taping (KT) is one of the recently noticed techniques in the rehabilitation of swallowing and feeding disorders. Given the novelty of this technique in research and practice, the present scoping review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the effects of KT on the oropharyngeal function related to swallowing, and to identify current knowledge gaps to guide future studies. The initial comprehensive search was conducted in the six databases in November 2022 and then was updated in June 2023. Studies were independently reviewed by two authors to exclude all types of reviews and study protocols, studies published only in an abstract form and also studies that used KT for improving voice and dysarthria symptoms. The methodology of the included studies was also critically appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) standard tools by two authors. The results of the studies were categorized and reported based on their overall objectives. In final analysis, 21 articles were described. Study designs ranged from randomized control trials (RCTs) to the case reports. The effects of KT had been investigated on drooling, oral feeding skills of infants, immediate activation of swallowing muscles, and management of dysphagia in patients with stroke or cerebral palsy (CP). Although innovative approaches to use KT as a therapeutic method in swallowing disorders have been investigated in the studies, there are many methodological limitations that affected validity of the results. In general, it seems there is not enough evidence to add KT to the usual management of feeding and swallowing disorders yet. Further studies, therefore, are required to achieve more accurate conclusions in each of the objectives summarized in this study.\nPMID:\n39096332\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10739-6",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOrally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) dissolve rapidly in contact with saliva and have been reported to facilitate oral administration of medications in swallowing difficulties. However, their clinical benefits remain unclear because no previous studies have examined whether ODTs facilitate medication adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. This study evaluated the association between ODT prescriptions and clinical benefits using high-dimensional propensity score (hd-PS) matching to adjust for confounding factors. Using a large Japanese commercial medical and dental claims database, we identified patients aged ≥ 65 years with post-stroke dysphagia between April 2014 and March 2021. To compare 1-year outcomes of medication adherence, cardiovascular events, and aspiration pneumonia between patients taking ODTs and non-ODTs, we performed hd-PS matching. We identified 11,813 patients without ODTs and 3178 patients with ODTs. After hd-PS matching, 2246 pairs were generated. Medication adherence for 1 year, based on the proportion of days covered, was not significantly different between the non-ODT and ODT groups before (0.887 vs. 0.900, P = 0.999) and after hd-PS matching (0.889 vs. 0.902, P = 0.977). The proportion of cardiovascular events (0.898 vs. 0.893, P = 0.591) and aspiration pneumonia (0.380 vs. 0.372, P = 0.558) were also not significantly different between the groups. This study found no significant differences in medication adherence, cardiovascular diseases, or aspiration pneumonia between the non-ODT and ODT groups in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. Both groups achieved a proportion of days covered exceeding 80%. Clinicians may consider prescribing ODTs or non-ODTs based on patient preferences rather than solely on post-stroke conditions.\nPMID:\n39096331\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10737-8",

This study aimed to identify predictive variables for PSD among patients with spontaneous ICH. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult patients with acute spontaneous ICH, confirmed by brain computed tomography, from June 2019 to June 2023. We analyzed demographic, neuroimaging, and stroke-specific characteristics and rehabilitation indicators. PSD was evaluated using nasogastric (NG) tube retention and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) levels at 4 and 12 weeks post-ICH. Statistical analyses involved univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify PSD predictors. A total of 310 ICH patients were included in the study. At 4 weeks, significant predictors for NG tube retention included 24-hour National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, estimated glomerular filtration rate and sitting balance. At 12 weeks, hospital stay duration and ICH score were significant predictors for NG tube retention. Regarding the FOIS, significant predictors at 4 weeks included higher 24-hour NIHSS scores, compromised sitting balance, immobility-related complications, initial hematoma volume and intraventricular hemorrhages. At 12 weeks, older age and higher 24-hour NIHSS scores significantly predicted lower FOIS levels. Our findings demonstrate that PSD in ICH patients is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including stroke severity, renal function, and physical impairment. The study highlights the importance of early neurological assessment, physical function, and comprehensive management in improving swallowing outcomes, emphasizing a multifaceted approach to enhancing outcomes for ICH survivors.\nPMID:\n39066832\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10735-w",

The scale measures the severity of residue in the vallecula and pyriform sinus. Ninety Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing images were selected after consensus and proposed to 13 raters who were asked to assess the severity of pharyngeal residue (PR) in each image in two moments with an interval of two weeks. The raters were divided by years of experience conducting the Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing and in experience using severity scales for residues. Construct validity, inter-rater, and intra-rater reliability were assessed by kappa statistics. The original English scale was translated into European Portuguese using a forward-backward method for validation. The scale reliability was strong, with an elevated intra-rater internal consistency for vallecula (Cronbach's alpha = 0.982) and pyriform sinus (Cronbach's alpha = 0.922). Inter-rater reliability for raters was equally significant and high for vallecula (0.613 for first assessment and 0.604 for second assessment) and pyriform sinus (0.558 for first assessment and 0.509 for second assessment) or for raters with experience using Yale Pharyngeal Severity Rating Scale (vallecula with 0.832 for first assessment and 0.717 for second assessment and pyriform sinus with 0.856 for first assessment and 0.714 for second assessment).The European Portuguese version of the Yale Pharyngeal Severity Rating Scale is a valid, reliable instrument for scoring the location and severity of pharyngeal residue in the context of fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.\nPMID:\n39060512\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10731-0",

Although it was developed using videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, it is frequently used to rate Flexible Endoscopic Evaluations of Swallowing. The validity and reliability of DOSS-use with FEES, however, has not previously been evaluated. This study investigated the validity and rater reliability of clinicians using DOSS to rate FEES. Eleven Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) with varied dysphagia experience were recruited to review and DOSS-rate 17 soundless FEES (198 bolus swallows) recorded from 11 heterogenic dysphagic patients (2 cases with repeat FEES) and 4 healthy adults. The SLPs DOSS-ratings were compared against the initial comprehensive dysphagia evaluation (including patient diagnosis, interview, cranial nerve and complete FEES assessment) with Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and DOSS outcome measures. The SLPs were blinded to patient details and comprehensive dysphagia examination. Re-randomised rating of FEES cases occurred two weeks later (intra rater reliability). Criterion validity for DOSS-ratings (compared against comprehensive dysphagia evaluation with FOIS and DOSS) were strong-very strong (r\ns\n= 0.858 and 0.936 respectively; p < 0.001). Inter rater reliability demonstrated high agreement (α = 0.891), also intra rater reliability demonstrated almost perfect agreement (Kw = 0.945). This study's results, with strong-very strong criterion validity and high rater reliability by SLPs, adds to the evidence for DOSS-use with FEES.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a pureed diet with either a gelling agent or a xanthan gum-based thickener to prevent pharyngeal residues in patients with dysphagia. We retrospectively analyzed a randomized, crossover trial of pureed rice with either a gelling agent or a xanthan gum-based thickener in patients with dysphagia. The enrolled patients were classified into mild and moderate-to-severe dysphagia groups. The primary outcome measure was degree of need for cyclic ingestion using test jelly for pharyngeal residuals (cyclic ingestion score). The secondary outcome was the patient's sense of material remaining in the throat following swallowing. Sixty-two patients (58% men; mean age 83 ± 9 years) with dysphagia were included. They were classified into mild dysphagia (n = 26) and moderate-to-severe dysphagia (n = 36) groups. In the moderate-to-severe dysphagia group, pharyngeal residuals were significantly less likely with pureed diets using a gelling agent than with those using a xanthan gum-based thickener, with respective median cyclic ingestion scores (range) of 1 (0-4) vs. 2.5 (0-4) (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in pharyngeal residuals between the pureed diets in the mild dysphagia group. The multivariate analysis identified gelling agent as an important factor significantly associated with less pharyngeal residual after swallowing of pureed diet in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia. Pureed diets thickened by a gelling agent decrease pharyngeal residues in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia and may reduce risk of aspiration pneumonia.\nPMID:\n39017926\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10734-x",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nDysphagia is the most common serious complication after stroke, with an incidence of about 37-78%, which seriously affects the independence of patients in daily life and clinical recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, is an emerging option for post-stroke dysphagia. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a new mode of transcranial magnetic stimulation that simulates the frequency of pulses released in the hippocampus.Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to increase cortical excitability and improve swallowing function in patients. Our study sought to summarize existing clinical randomized controlled trials to provide evidence-based medical evidence for the clinical use of iTBS. A computer search was conducted on 4 Chinese (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Information Resource System, CNKI, and Wanfang Medical Science) and 4 English (including Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science) databases to retrieve all randomized controlled trials in Chinese and English that explored the effects of Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation for post-stroke dysphagia. The retrieval years are from database construction to 23 November 2023. The primary outcome measure was a change in Penetration/Aspiration Scale (PAS), Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Secondary outcomes included Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS), water-swallowing test (WST) etc. A meta-analysis by Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was performed with RevMan 5.3. we appraise risk of bias(RoB) of each study with the Cochrane RoB tool. Detailed instructions for using the Cochrane RoB tool are provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (The Cochrane Handbook). Nine studies were obtained from eight databases after screening by inclusion and exclusion criteria, 567 patients from 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and one study was included in the qualitative analysis due to different control groups. Two of the nine studies had an unclear risk of bias, and four studies were at low risk. The results showed that iTBS significantly improved SSA, PAS, FOIS, and PAS scores in stroke patients compared to the control group(P < 0.05), and promoted swallowing function recovery. Our systematic review provides the first evidence of the efficacy of iTBS in improving dysphagia in stroke patients. However, the number of available studies limits the persuasiveness of the evidence and further validation by additional randomized controlled trials is needed.\nPMID:\n39008039\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10729-8",

Specifically, differences in cortical activation during normal saliva swallows, effortful swallows, and tongue pressing were investigated. Nine healthy, right-handed adults (5 female, 4 male; Age: 22-30 years) were recruited. The tasks included were (1) normal saliva swallowing, (2) effortful saliva swallowing, and (3) lingual pressing against the palate. Each task was completed three times in a block, for a total of five blocks. Blocks were randomized and presented with set time intervals using PsychoPy. Motor activity was highest during effortful swallows, followed by normal swallows, and lingual presses. Activation in the sensory region was not significantly different across tasks; however, effortful swallows elicited the highest mean peak activation. Our findings suggest that fNIRS can be a viable imaging method used to examine differences in cortical activity in the context of swallowing. Its applicability in future dysphagia research should be explored.\nPMID:\n38980390\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10730-1",

We conducted a dynamic, ambidirectional cohort study involving 148 subjects at risk of dysphagia in a tertiary university hospital. Our aim was to determine the risk of pneumonia attributed to alterations in swallowing safety detected during FEES. We used multivariate negative binomial regression models to adjust for potential confounders. The incidence density rate (IR) of pneumonia in patients with tracheal aspiration of any consistency was 26.6/100 people-years (RR 7.25; 95% CI: 3.50-14.98; P < 0.001). The IR was 19.7/100 people-years (RR 7.85; 95% CI: 3.34-18.47; P < 0.001) in those with laryngeal penetration of any consistency and 18.1/100 people-years (RR 6.24; 95% CI: 2.58-15.09; P < 0.001) in those with pharyngeal residue of any consistency. When adjusted for aspiration, the association of residue and penetration with pneumonia disappeared, suggesting that their risk of pneumonia is dependent on the presence of aspiration and that only aspiration is independently associated with pneumonia. This increased risk of pneumonia was significant in uni- and multivariate negative binomial regression models. We found an independently increased risk of pneumonia among patients with dysphagia and aspiration detected during FEES. Alterations in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, without aspiration, did not increase the risk of pneumonia.\nPMID:\n38958706\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10727-w",

However, the psychosocial effect of an individual's dysphagia on those that care for them is less known. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically efficient, statistically robust companion-reported outcomes measure to the Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI) to better understand the impact of a patient's dysphagia on their companions as related to physical, emotional and functional domains of health-related quality of life. Seventy-seven initial statements describing companion perceptions of dysphagia were divided into physical, emotional and functional subscales. The statements were administered to 75 consecutive companions of individuals with dysphagia. Respondents replied never, almost never, sometimes, almost always and always to each statement and rated their companion's dysphagia severity on a 7-point equal appearing interval scale. Cronbach's α was performed to assess the internal consistency validation of the statements. The final questionnaire was reduced to 25 items and administered to 317 companions of individuals with dysphagia and 31 controls.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in pulmonary rehabilitation programs (PRPs) are not routinely screened for dysphagia. An Australian regional health service audit revealed that patients with COPD are frequently referred to speech pathology during acute admissions, rather than proactively to mitigate the risk of dysphagia-related consequences. Referral patterns to speech pathology using a novel transdisciplinary approach for identifying at risk for dysphagia patients in a PRP were explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a transdisciplinary dysphagia screening questionnaire on speech pathology referrals within a cohort of patients with COPD enrolled in a PRP. This quasi-experimental study introduced a dysphagia screening questionnaire in a PRP using a transdisciplinary approach. A retrospective audit of PRP patients (n = 563) between 01/01/2014 and 31/12/2018 was conducted to identify the frequency of referrals to speech pathology for dysphagia. Data was compared to a cohort of patients (n = 50) enrolled in the PRP (from 01/02/21 to 30/11/21) after introduction of the questionnaire using Fisher's exact test. Less than 1% (n = 4/563) of PRP patients were referred to speech pathology prior to implementation of the questionnaire. Following the implementation, referrals to speech pathology significantly increased to 16% (8/50) (X\n2\n= 7.72, P < 0.05; odds ratio = 7.89 95% CI [1.94, 32.1]). Introducing a dysphagia screening questionnaire increased referrals to speech pathology from a PRP. This study demonstrated the potential for a transdisciplinary approach in early screening for patients at risk of dysphagia for patients with COPD. Further research is encouraged to explore patient motivation towards speech pathology input with COPD-related dysphagia and clinicians' perceived self-efficacy in using the questionnaire.\nPMID:\n38951236\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10713-2",

Although cognitive impairment may contribute to dysphagia, few studies have investigated the association between the PD neuropsychological profile and objective measures of swallowing dysfunction. Since the swallowing function comprises involuntary but also voluntary actions, we hypothesize that specific measures of attention and executive functions can be underlined in PD-related dysphagia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to extensively investigate the correlation and the relationship between attentive and executive functions and safety/efficiency of pharyngeal phase of swallowing in people with PD. All participants received a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and were evaluated using the Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS); the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (IT-YPRSRS), and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS-IT). Participants also underwent a neuropsychological assessment covering global cognitive status, attention, and frontal executive functions. Correlations and associations between neuropsychological measures and swallowing components were calculated. Twenty-one participants with PD (mean age 69.38 ± 6.58 years, mean disease duration 8.38 ± 5.31 years; mean MDS-UPDRS III 43.95 ± 24.18) completed all evaluations. The most significant correlations were found between attentive functions (i.e., Stroop Time), and executive functions (i.e., Raven's Progressive Matrices, Digit Backward and Semantic Fluency), and FOIS-IT, PAS, and IT-YPRSRS sinuses and valleculae. These associations were not influenced by disease duration. These results suggest that a dysfunction to attentional processes and/or to executive functions can contribute to penetration and the presence of pharyngeal residue in participants with middle-stage PD.\nPMID:\n38951235\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10728-9",

The Dynamic Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) is an EBP tool developed in 2016 for videofluoroscopy in head and neck (H&N) oncology with clinical implementation as a goal. We sought to examine: (1) feasibility of clinical implementation of DIGEST in a national comprehensive cancer center, and (2) fidelity of DIGEST adoption in real-world practice. A retrospective implementation evaluation was conducted in accordance with the STARI framework. Electronic health record (EHR) databases were queried for all consecutive modified barium swallow (MBS) studies conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2016 to 2021. Implementation outcomes included: feasibility as measured by DIGEST reporting in EHR (as a marker of clinical use) and fidelity as measured by accuracy of DIGEST reporting relative to the decision-tree logic (penetration-aspiration scale [PAS], residue, and Safety [S] and Efficiency [E] grades). Contextual factors examined included year, setting, cancer type, MBS indication, and provider. 13,055 MBS were conducted by 29 providers in 7,842 unique patients across the lifespan in diverse oncology populations (69% M; age 1-96 years; 58% H&N cancer; 10% inpatient, 90% outpatient). DIGEST was reported in 12,137/13,088 exams over the 6-year implementation period representing 93% (95% CI: 93-94%) adoption in all exams and 99% (95% CI: 98-99%) of exams excluding the total laryngectomy population (n = 730). DIGEST reporting varied modestly by year, cancer type, and setting/provider (> 91% in all subgroups, p < 0.001). Accuracy of DIGEST reporting was high for overall DIGEST (incorrect SE profile 1.6%, 200/12,137), DIGEST-safety (incorrect PAS 0.4% 51/12,137) and DIGEST-efficiency (incorrect residue 1.2%, 148/12,137). Clinical implementation of DIGEST was feasible with high fidelity in a busy oncology practice across a large number of providers. Adoption of the tool across the lifespan in diverse cancer diagnoses may motivate validation beyond H&N oncology.\nPMID:\n38935170\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10721-2",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The perception of a clinical condition or disorder can vary across patients from different cultural-linguistic backgrounds. There is insufficient evidence to inspect this potential impact on the perception of vocal fatigue (VF) as a common condition perceived by patients with voice disorders. In order to more comprehensively explore this phenomenon, a systematic review was carried out to investigate the differences in perceived VF in a variety of cultural-linguistic contexts, based on a standard self-assessment instrument-the Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI), as translated in different languages.\nMETHOD: A thorough search was done in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar by March 2024. Cross-sectional studies investigating the accuracy of the VFI to detect perceived VF in all available languages were considered. The VFI has three distinct parts or factors assessing: (a) tiredness of voice, (b) physical discomfort associated with voicing, and (c) improvement of symptoms with rest. The cutoff points and sensitivity and specificity of each factor were submitted to meta-analysis, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine pooled sensitivity and specificity of each factor of the VFI.\nRESULTS: Eight papers that examined the diagnostic accuracy of the VFI in English, Malayalam, Turkish, German, Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Cantonese, and Finnish languages were identified as being eligible for this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity along with their confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: 0.91 CI [0.80, 0.96] and 0.88 CI [0.78, 0.94] for Factor 1, 0.83 CI [0.69, 0.91] and 0.84 CI [0.76, 0.89] for Factor 2, and 0.75 CI [0.67, 0.82] and 0.77 CI [0.59, 0.89] for Factor 3.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present research demonstrates medium to high but heterogeneous accuracy of the VFI for detecting perceived VF across cultural-linguistic contexts. Given the promising results, future studies should focus on (a) further investigating the underlying factors for the observed heterogeneity in diagnostic accuracy and (b) adapting and validating the VFI in more languages toward establishing its validity as a cross-linguistic diagnostic tool for the perception of VF.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26397106.\nPMID:\n39102609\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-24-00043",

Although poststroke depression (PSD) and poststroke dysphagia are known to occur concurrently, there is a paucity of research that has specifically investigated their association. Therefore, we aimed to study the relationship between PSD and poststroke dysphagia during acute inpatient hospitalization and within 90 days after discharge. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the odds and hazard of being diagnosed with depression after stroke and estimate the time to depression diagnosis from the initial stroke diagnosis in patients with and without a diagnosis of dysphagia.\nMETHOD: Using the acute inpatient hospital data set from our previous work, we pulled additional postdischarge administrative claims data from the 2017 Medicare 5% Limited Data Set and conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of patients diagnosed with poststroke dysphagia and PSD.\nRESULTS: Patients diagnosed with poststroke dysphagia had 2.7 higher odds of being diagnosed with PSD and had an approximately 1.75-fold higher hazard for PSD diagnosis in the 90 days after discharge compared to patients not diagnosed with dysphagia. Risk factors for PSD included having dysphagia, being female, and having dual eligibility.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated a significant association between PSD and poststroke dysphagia. Additional research should further explore the impact of PSD on poststroke dysphagia.\nPMID:\n39088240\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00264",

Measures included questions related to demographic and injury characteristics, executive functioning, social relations, health-related quality of life, and fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints.\nRESULTS: Fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints were persistent and ultimately increased at 16 months postinjury. Over half of the participants were experiencing each symptom at 16 months postinjury (i.e., 52.94% fatigue and fogginess, 58.82% sleep complaints). At 16 months postinjury, fatigue was significantly associated with female sex, and fatigue and sleep complaints were significantly associated with lower physical quality of life, but no other differences were found with symptoms and current functioning.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support that fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints can persist (from baseline, from postinjury, and in fluctuation) chronically for about half of the children with TBI but little association or impact on other domains of functioning. The present study supports the continued investigation of fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints after childhood brain injury, but further investigation with a larger sample size is necessary to inform clinical practices for assessment and management, particularly for speech-language pathologists in rehabilitation and educational settings.\nPMID:\n39083509\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-24-00108",

The study also aimed to determine how these problems impact their ability to engage socially and find satisfaction in their social roles.\nMETHOD: This study employed a cross-sectional survey to collect data from adult cancer survivors. The survey included questions on demographic characteristics, self-perceived cognitive-communication abilities, social engagement, and satisfaction with social participation. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests, and Kruskal-Wallis\nH\ntests.\nRESULTS: Of 172 participants, 78% completed the survey, with 109 self-reporting CRCI. The participants predominantly had breast cancer, and most were diagnosed with Stage II cancers. The results indicated self-perceived impairment in various cognitive-communication domains, with functional daily communication being the most affected. Participants reported more difficulty participating in social roles and activities than their overall satisfaction with social participation. This study explored the relationships between cognitive-communication scores and social engagement, considering variables such as education, cancer type, stage, age, and treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the multidimensional nature of CRCI, emphasizing the importance of addressing both cognitive-communication and social aspects in interventions and support services. It highlights the clinical implications for speech-language pathology, suggesting a potential role in identifying and addressing cognitive-communication deficits.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Measuring real-world communication participation of individuals with aphasia is complicated. Historically, this has been estimated through subjective participant or proxy self-report. To address potential inaccuracies, objective measures such as \"talk time\" have been proposed. Although promising, technological barriers to collecting and quantifying everyday conversations have been documented (e.g., background noise interference, differentiating recorded speakers, and operating Bluetooth applications). This study explored the use of a novel laryngeal sensor and a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker with the objective of measuring mean talk time per hour and participant locations across three 8-hr days.\nMETHOD: Sixteen participants utilized a wearable laryngeal sensor that captures physiological mechano-acoustic signals wirelessly, without recording speech content. The sensor differentiates speech from other laryngeal movements associated with swallowing and coughing. A GPS tracker was also issued to track daily locations. Semistructured interviews regarding feasibility and acceptability were conducted with participants at the end of the data collection period.\nRESULTS: Across all participants, laryngeal sensor data were collected for a total of 38 days and GPS data for a total of 43 days, with a mean collection period of 8.21 hr (\nSD\n= 1.38) per day. Mean talk time per hour was 56.46 s (\nSD\n= 35.27). Participants were tracked at a mean of 2.09 locations daily (range: 1-6). Participants reported the devices were relatively comfortable to wear and easy to use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings indicated that talk time of individuals with aphasia is limited, though variable. Higher fluency ratings were related to greater mean talk time per hour and locations tracked. Results suggest wearable technology is feasible to use and acceptable to people with aphasia. In the future, wearable devices may offer innovative ways to measure communication participation.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26237531.\nPMID:\n39073093\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00373",

Here, we generated a modern, full-color set of 310 illustrations representing a carefully designed, culturally sensitive list of imageable nouns. We normed the images in a diverse sample of healthy adults, so the images can be used in various populations, including older adults.\nMETHOD: We recruited a diverse online sample of 200 adults ages 19-76 years. Participants typed a name for each picture and reported how familiar they were with the item (familiarity) and how well the illustration matched their mental image of the item (image agreement). We assessed relationships among these three measures, between these measures and word features (e.g., frequency, length), and between these measures and demographic characteristics of our sample.\nRESULTS: Two hundred ninety-seven of 310 items had 70% or higher name agreement among participants. Most items had good to excellent image agreement and familiarity. The image measures showed expected relationships with relevant word features (e.g., frequency, length). Older age was associated with higher image agreement and familiarity but not written naming accuracy. As a group, Black participants demonstrated lower written naming accuracy than White and mixed race participants. Education, sex, and self-reported multilingualism were not significantly related to image measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: We generated a novel set of illustrations with strong name agreement, familiarity, and image agreement, which are suitable for a variety of uses in research and clinical settings. Our normative data suggest a future need for item-level analysis to explore variability in performance across different racial groups.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26321926.\nPMID:\n39058933\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00401",

This study aims to evaluate perspectives of health care providers and nonspeaking patients on effective communication and communication barriers in the ICU.\nMETHOD: Qualitative and quantitative survey methodologies were employed to evaluate providers' and patients' perspectives on effective communication. Rating scales were utilized to measure patients' frustration levels and communication effectiveness. Open-ended questions were employed to reflect on barriers to communication in the ICU, instances of ineffective communication, and recommendations for enhancing effective communication.\nRESULTS: The results of the study suggest that nonspeaking patients experienced high levels of frustration due to ineffective communication. However, the data reveal that access to appropriate augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies and materials could help mitigate patients' frustration. Providers mainly communicated via asking yes/no questions, which largely limited the information patients conveyed, leading to frequent communication breakdowns. Providers expressed a desire to participate in training programs to utilize appropriate AAC strategies and promote effective communication.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary survey results on perspectives of patients and providers on effective communication in the ICU. Both providers and patients reported experiencing challenges and frustration during their communication, due to barriers such as providers' insufficient training experience and lack of access to AAC materials. Skill training is warranted to promote effective patient-provider communication in intensive care settings.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26339623.\nPMID:\n39052424\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00385",

Each child completed routine speech production and vocabulary assessments, as well as experimental speech perception and word learning tasks. The results from these tasks were then used to create profiles of each child's individual strengths and needs across the abilities assessed.\nRESULTS: Although all four children presented with phonological impairment and lexically precocious receptive and expressive vocabulary, they differed in their specific speech errors. One child presented with phonological speech errors only, while the other three children presented with an interdental lisp alongside their phonological errors. Three children presented with average speech perception abilities, and one child presented with poorer speech perception. The same three children also showed some learning of novel nonwords 1 week post-initial exposure, while the other child showed no evidence of word learning 1 week post-initial exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical profiles of lexically precocious children with phonological impairment offered different insights into the nature of the problem. Although one child appeared to present with underspecified underlying representations of words, the other three children appeared to present with well-specified underlying representations. Of the three children with well-specified underlying representations, two appeared to have difficulty abstracting particular rules of the ambient phonological system. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the underlying nature of phonological impairment.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26307640.\nPMID:\n39028570\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00370",

However, test items confound linguistic factors that make sentences difficult for PWA. The current study systematically manipulated semantic plausibility and word order in sentences like those in SC to examine how these factors affect comprehension deficits in aphasia.\nMETHOD: Fifty Korean speakers (25 PWA and 25 controls) completed a sentence-picture matching task that manipulated word order (canonical vs. noncanonical) and semantic plausibility (plausible vs. less plausible). Analyses focused on accuracy and aimed to identify sentence types that best discriminate the groups. Additionally, we explored which sentence type serves as the best predictor of aphasia severity.\nRESULTS: PWA demonstrated greater difficulties in processing less plausible sentences than plausible ones compared to the controls. Across the groups, noncanonical and less plausible sentences elicited lower accuracy than canonical and plausible sentences. Notably, the accuracy of PWA and control groups differed in noncanonical and less plausible sentences. Additionally, aphasia severity significantly correlated with less plausible sentences.\nCONCLUSION: Even in languages with flexible word order, PWA find it challenging to process sentences with noncanonical syntactic structures and less plausible semantic roles.\nPMID:\n38991166\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00353",

The current quasi-experimental study seeks to expand on research indicating that matched neurotype pairs tend to communicate more effectively than mixed neurotype pairs by examining communication across and within neurotypes in an expository language context.\nMETHOD: Thirty autistic adults and 28 nonautistic adults were paired in either a matched neurotype or mixed neurotype condition. The pairs' interactions involved giving and listening to directions to draw an image. Interactions were recorded, transcribed, and coded for communication accuracy, rate, and clarity. Participants also completed a survey about the rapport they experienced in the interaction.\nRESULTS: Matched neurotype pairs were significantly more accurate in their communication than mixed neurotype pairs. Rate was fastest among mixed neurotype pairs, but clarity did not differ significantly across conditions. Matched autistic pairs reported significantly lower rapport than other pairs.\nCONCLUSIONS: This finding lends further support to the neurodiversity model by demonstrating that autistic communication is not inherently deficient. Further research is necessary to investigate a variety of influences on rate, clarity, and rapport development. Clinical implications include considerations for neurodiversity-affirming communication supports for expository contexts such as classroom directions or workplace instructions.\nPMID:\n38991165\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00393",

Parent-child free-play recordings were used to quantify the (para)linguistic features of the children's speech. Executive function was measured via parent report.\nRESULTS: The preterm-born group obtained significantly lower scores than the term-born group on all Bayley language measures (though differences were not consistently observed when using cutoff scores). Few preterm-term differences in LSA measures were found. The preterm-term differences in Bayley scores were not explained by between-group differences in executive function. Some preterm-term differences in LSA scores were moderated by the language sampling context. The preterm- and term-born groups exhibited different patterns of Bayley-LSA correlations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preterm language difficulties were more apparent on standardized test than LSA scores. Nonetheless, the Bayley-LSA correlations indicate that poor test performance (linked with preterm birth) is associated with functional communication difficulties. The discussion outlines the complementary utility of standardized tests and LSA while acknowledging the limited utility of cutoff scores and the confounding influence of the language sampling context.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26142661.\nPMID:\n38980152\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00318",

Reports of common co-occurrence suggest these neurodevelopmental disruptions might also be linked. Most of the data available on the issue have been based on case-control studies vulnerable to ascertainment and other biases.\nMETHOD: Seventy-eight children, representing four neurodevelopmental profiles (DLD, ADHD, co-occurring ADHD + DLD, and neurotypical development), were administered a battery of psycholinguistic tests. Parents provided standardized ratings of the severity of their children's inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and executive function symptoms. Examiners were blinded to children's clinical status. Group differences, correlations, and best subset regression analyses were used to examine potential impacts of children's ADHD symptoms on their psycholinguistic abilities.\nRESULTS: For children with DLD, significant links between their ADHD symptoms and psycholinguistic abilities were limited to the contributions of elevated hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms to lower pragmatic abilities. For children without DLD, inattention symptoms contributed to lower levels of performance in pragmatic, sentence recall, receptive vocabulary, and narrative abilities.\nDISCUSSION: Links among children's ADHD symptoms and their psycholinguistic abilities were different for children with and without DLD. Implications for the provision of clinical services are discussed.\nPMID:\n38980144\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00388",

Seven studies met the search criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. For each participant, individual accuracy scores for the comprehension of personal and reflexive pronouns were extracted in addition to information on the study methods. Individual accuracy data were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and the binomial test. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis had three main findings: (a) The majority of the persons with agrammatic aphasia (89%) had no dissociation between the comprehension of personal and reflexive pronouns; (b) 8% revealed a pattern consistent with a neuropsychological dissociation, faring worse on the comprehension of personal than reflexive pronouns; and (c) 2% performed worse on reflexive than personal pronouns. The type of the task used affected pronoun comprehension accuracy and accounted for the heterogeneity in the patterns of pronoun comprehension attested across the different participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the meta-analysis did not support a dissociation between personal and reflexive pronoun comprehension in agrammatic comprehension. When confirmed, the dissociation was driven by task effects. The clinical implications of these findings were discussed together with implications to minimize the risk of bias in future examinations of the topic.\nPMID:\n38968276\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00343",

Recently, there has been growing evidence of public health concept applications in fields related to speech, language, and hearing. However, there is an outstanding need to explicitly define the intersection of public health, including prevention and health promotion, and the discipline of communication sciences and disorders (CSD) across the areas of education, clinical practice, research, and policy. The authors propose a definition for this intersection using the new term\ncommunication public health\n.\nMETHOD: This tutorial provides guidance on how to conceptualize communication public health and invites refinement and expansion of the intersection between public health and CSD. Because readers are experts in CSD, this tutorial aims to supplement existing knowledge with information on public health to achieve three main objectives: (a) increase knowledge of the application of public health concepts among speech, language, hearing, and related professionals (SLHP+); (b) introduce the concept of communication public health; and (c) discuss the relevance of communication public health across domains within CSD. The authors utilize the socioecological model to provide examples of applications.\nRESULTS: The concept of communication public health is proposed as the collaborative area of CSD and public health, which encompasses prevention and promotion of equity in communication health through individual-, community-, and population-level efforts. The goals of communication public health are achieved through applications of public health principles in CSD education, clinical practice, research, and policy.\nCONCLUSION: Communication public health defines an area of collaboration between public health and CSD in which SLHP+ can apply public health concepts to both advance communication health and address health disparities.\nPMID:\n39083459\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00491",

All children underwent speech-ABR testing, cognitive assessment using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, and a continuous performance test.\nRESULTS: Children with ADHD exhibited significantly longer latencies of speech-ABR waveforms V, A, and D compared to TD children. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the latencies of speech-ABR waves V, A, and D were affected by the presence of ADHD, but not by the full-scale intelligence quotient.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that preschool children with ADHD exhibited abnormal AP of speech signals in their CANS. The findings suggest that speech-ABR can be utilized as a reliable measure to evaluate AP ability in this population, as it remains unaffected by cognitive or attentional factors. The transient response (V, A) of speech-ABR was found to be a significant predictor of ADHD in a clinical setting. Early assessment of AP abnormalities via speech-ABR is recommended in preschool-age children to develop targeted interventions for ADHD.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26376502.\nPMID:\n39083453\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00454",

Analyses were primarily descriptive and relied on distribution-free medians, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), and population-weighted prevalence estimates. Differences between CDFs were examined using Cohen's\nh\neffect size. Results are presented for the age range of 6-19 years. Main effects of sex, age, and race/ethnicity were examined.\nRESULTS: Differences in the audiograms between the sexes and among the various race/ethnicity groups were minor, but age group differences were notable. Pure-tone thresholds at 500 and 8000 Hz for the 6- to 9-year age group were 3-5 dB higher (worse) than those of the other age groups. The overall prevalence of hearing loss among 6- to 19-year-olds, defined as either of the pure-tone averages (PTAs) for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz (PTA512) or 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz (PTA3468k) exceeding 15 dB HL in either ear, was 11.24% (95% confidence interval [10.00%, 12.48%]). Binary logistic regression analyses found the odds of hearing loss to be significantly higher for individuals from families with a low income as well as for those with abnormal otoscopy or abnormal tympanometry.\nCONCLUSIONS: For children and adolescents in the United States, hearing was unaffected by differences in sex and race/ethnicity, with only age impacting pure-tone thresholds and only at the lowest (500 Hz) and highest (8000 Hz) frequencies examined. The overall prevalence of hearing loss was about 11%.\nPMID:\n39083446\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00050",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The Arabic verb system features a nonlinear root and pattern derivational morphology. Previous studies suggest that young Arabic and Hebrew speakers' early verb use is based on semantic complexity rather than derivational morphological structure. The present study examines the role of morphological and semantic complexity in the emergence of the verb\nderivational\nmorphology in Arabic speaking children with developmental language disorder (DLD) compared to children with typical language development (TLD).\nMETHOD: Natural language data were collected from native Arabic-speaking children (40 with DLD; aged 4-6 years and 133 with TLD aged 2;6-6;0 [years;months]) using picture-based elicitation tasks, and verbs were coded morphologically for derivational features and for features of semantic complexity.\nRESULTS: The results showed that children with DLD demonstrated a more limited production of verb patterns, both in types and in tokens, than age-matched children with TLD. Also, children with DLD age 5;0-6;0 were similar in types and tokens of verb patterns to younger children with TLD at the age of 3;6-4 years. Moreover, while children with TLD at the age of 2;6-3 years used a smaller number of verb patterns than older 4;0-5;0 aged children with DLD, the two groups were not different in verb semantics. Finally, the morphological and semantic diversity demonstrated by the children with DLD was similar to the morphological and semantic diversity shown by children with TLD.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings support the conclusion that children with DLD and with TLD acquire the derivational verb system in the same pathway and the quantitative lexical differences between the two groups support a delay rather than a deviation from the typical developmental trajectory.\nPMID:\n39058937\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00558",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Target word activation in picture naming was explored in children who stutter (CWS) and typically fluent children (TFC) using event-related potentials (ERPs).\nMETHOD: A total of 18 CWS and 16 TFC completed a task combining picture naming and probe word identification. On each trial, a picture-to-be-named was followed by an auditory probe word-to-be-identified; the probe was identical (Identity condition) or Unrelated to the picture name. ERPs were recorded from probe onset. Attenuation of the N400 ERP component was predicted to Identity versus Unrelated trials (N400 priming). Between-groups differences in amplitude, timing, and topography of N400 priming were explored.\nRESULTS: Naming was more accurate on Identity versus Unrelated trials. Probe word identification accuracy was not affected by Condition. N400 priming was detected, indicating that self-generated picture names facilitated semantic processing of identical probes. This effect was larger in amplitude in CWS versus TFC. Unexpectedly, an N400-preceding, frontally maximal, positive-going ERP component-associated with expectancy processing-was larger in amplitude to Unrelated versus Identity trials. This effect was smaller in CWS versus TFC.\nCONCLUSIONS: A larger N400 priming effect in CWS versus TFC reflects a tendency toward more extensive semantic processing in picture naming in CWS. A smaller Condition effect on frontally maximal, positive-going, N400-preceding ERP activity in CWS versus TFC indicates a reduced ability to form expectancies about the lexical and/or phonological identity of probe words in CWS. Both effects may point to inefficient activation of target words in picture naming in CWS.\nPMID:\n39058928\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00570",

All children were assessed in Italian on vocabulary, receptive morphosyntax, and morphological markers for DLD in the Italian language (i.e., third-person verb inflections, definite articles, third-person direct-object clitic pronouns, simple prepositions) and nonverbal inhibitory control skills. Group performance was compared using a series of one-way analyses of variance.\nRESULTS: Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD achieved significantly lower performance in all language measures compared to both TD monolingual and bilingual children. However, TD bilinguals, although comprehensively showing better language skills than monolinguals with DLD, achieved a performance closer to that of monolinguals with DLD but significantly higher than that of bilinguals with DLD. Both TD monolinguals and bilinguals showed better results than both DLD groups in inhibitory control tasks, particularly in the interference suppression task.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides a picture of language and inhibitory control characteristics of children with various language profiles and adds to the literature on potential markers of DLD among bilingual children. These results suggest that the assessment of nonlinguistic markers, which are associated with language impairment, could be a useful approach to better specify the diagnosis of DLD and reduce cases of misdiagnosis in the context of bilingualism.\nPMID:\n39058921\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00368",

These tasks consisted of speech and nonspeech stimuli differing in spectral or temporal cues. We then used independent-samples\nt\n-tests to assess differences in phonetic categorization slopes between groups and linear mixed-effects models to test differences in nonspeech auditory processing between stuttering and nonstuttering groups, and stuttering severity as a function of performance on all auditory processing tasks.\nRESULTS: We found statistically significant differences between people who do and do not stutter in phonetic categorization of a continuum differing in a temporal cue and in discrimination of nonspeech stimuli differing in a spectral cue. A significant proportion of variance in self-reported stuttering severity was predicted by performance on the auditory processing measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that people who stutter process both speech and nonspeech auditory information differently than people who do not stutter and may point to subtle differences in auditory processing that could contribute to stuttering.

Epub 2024 Jul 25.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This article describes DigiSpan, a new computer-controlled auditory test of forward and reverse digit span, designed to be administered by clinicians, and presents normative and test-retest reliability data for adults.\nMETHOD: DigiSpan mimics conventional live-voice tests in that it commences with trials that ascend in length until a stopping criterion is met, giving rise to a conventional scaled score. It then administers five additional adaptive trials, the length of which depends on the correctness of the response to the previous trial. Each of these two segments of the measurement gives rise to a scaled score. The ascending and adaptive scores are averaged to give an overall score and subtracted to produce an internal measure of consistency, and hence reliability. Young adults with an\nM\nage\nof 25 years (\nN\n= 163) were tested, of whom 65 were retested on a separate day.\nRESULTS: The scaled scores from the conventional ascending trials were highly consistent with existing normative data based on live-voice tests. Combination of the conventional scaled score with a scaled score based on the adaptive trials led to 44% reduction in error variance for forward memory span and 20% reduction for reverse memory span. The average of these (32%) is similar to but (insignificantly) less than the 42% reduction in error variance that can be predicted based on adding the five adaptive trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: Replacing live-voice production of digits by a clinician with recorded, computer-controlled production has not affected the difficulty of the test. Adding five additional trials around the sequence length that a test participant can just remember has produced a decrease in measurement error. In addition, the availability of separate scaled scores for the ascending and adaptive phases enables the reliability of the combined score to be checked, for both forward and reverse measurements. The combination of standardized delivery, increased accuracy, internal reliability check, and fast automated scoring makes the test highly suitable for clinical use.\nPMID:\n39052433\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00466",

This study examined to what extent narrative discourse comprehension accounts for narrative discourse production outcomes (story grammar, story completeness). A secondary aim was to provisionally test an assumption of a discourse model, the structure building framework (SBF), that discourse comprehension and production share cognitive processes by investigating the strength of the relationship between them.\nMETHOD: Twenty-one individuals with TBI completed story comprehension and story retelling tasks. Discourse measures included the Discourse Comprehension Test, a picture story comprehension task, story grammar, and story completeness. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were performed using comprehension measures as predictors for production measures.\nRESULTS: There were significant moderate-to-large correlations between all comprehension and production measures. Comprehension measures approached but did not reach significance for predicting story grammar performance but strongly predicted story completeness outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The story comprehension measures likely tapped content aspects of discourse more so than organization. Results provided support for a link between content-focused discourse comprehension measures and discourse production outcomes, which may have clinical implications for approaches to discourse intervention. Findings were interpreted as providing preliminary support for the SBF's claim that discourse production deploys the same processes involved in discourse comprehension.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26338045.\nPMID:\n39052432\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00681",

The developmental trajectory of gesture production during early childhood is understudied. Thus, little is known about the possible changes of gesture production over time. The present study aimed to document the development of gesture production in autistic children and examine whether child-based factors (chronological age and initial language skills) predicted gesture development.\nMETHOD: A total of 33 Chinese-speaking autistic children (\nM\nage\n= 56.39 months,\nSD\n= 8.54 months) played with their parents at four time points over a 9-month period. Their speech was transcribed, and their gestures were coded from parent-child interaction. Multilevel modeling analysis was used to investigate the development of gesture and its associated factors.\nRESULTS: The total number of gestures produced by autistic children decreased over time. Among different factors, children's initial age significantly and negatively predicted children's gesture production, while initial language positively predicted children's gesture production.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gesture delay persists in preschool age. The decline in gesture production was associated with children's age and initial language ability. These findings shed light on the difficulties surrounding gesture use in autistic children.\nPMID:\n39038241\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00241",

Epub 2024 Jul 18.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Developmental language disorder (DLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts approximately 7% of the population and is characterized by unexplained deficits in expressive and/or receptive components of language. A common procedural learning task, serial reaction time (SRT), has been used to develop models of the basis of DLD. However, paradigms involve differing levels of implicit and explicit learning during this task, muddying interpretations of the data. Here, we tested adults with DLD on implicit and explicit SRT tasks to better understand implicit and explicit procedural learning in this population. We hypothesized that adults with DLD would demonstrate reduced learning on only the implicit SRT task, as alternate explicit neural mechanisms could lead to equivalent performance on the explicit task.\nMETHOD: Fifty participants (25 with DLD and 25 with typical language) completed implicit and explicit SRT tasks, measuring their ability to learn visually presented 10-element sequences. Group differences were evaluated on sequence learning, error rates, and explicit recall of the sequence after learning.\nRESULTS: Sequence learning was the same between the groups on both tasks. However, individuals with DLD showed increased errors and significantly worse recall of the explicitly learned sequence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that sequence learning may be intact in this population, while aspects of explicit learning and motoric responses are impaired. Results are interpreted in light of a neurobiological model of DLD.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26210651.\nPMID:\n39024517\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00551",

Epub 2024 Jul 17.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Technology-enabled care, including the use of mobile health (mHealth), is emerging as a viable hearing health care delivery method. While the integration of mHealth with adult populations currently supports a wide array of hearing services, a better understanding of the implementation across the lifespan is needed. Literature surrounding the unique population of adolescent hearing aid users is currently lacking. Research is needed to highlight factors important to the use and clinical integration of mHealth hearing aid applications (apps) with adolescents. This study explored two primary objectives: (a) audiologists' perceptions around the use of mHealth apps to enable collaborative, child-inclusive hearing aid personalization, and (b) person-centered ideation around potential app design components to benefit users aged 12 to 17 years.\nMETHOD: Twelve audiologists participated in virtual synchronous focus groups, across three group sessions using Cisco Webex. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an inductive, codebook thematic analysis approach.\nRESULTS: Six main themes resulted from group discussion analyses: (a) client candidacy: characteristics impacting suitability for mHealth use; (b) clinical implementation: organizational, professional, or patient-level strategies for mHealth adoption; (c) collaboration: the use of two or more individuals working together; (d) empowerment: process of acquiring and using knowledge, skills, and strategies; (e) remote technology: technologies enabling remote hearing aid personalization; and (f) application functionality and design: features and characteristics important to an adolescent-focused app.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings identified the potential for clinical integration of hearing aid apps with adolescents in a collaborative care model, including consideration of child-specific use patterns, outcomes, and key design and technology components to support real-world implementation and use. Results may guide development and tailoring efforts around existing and future hearing aid apps for use with adolescent populations.\nPMID:\n39018271\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00679",

Epub 2024 Jul 17.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a visual cognitive additional task on balance performance in young adults with hearing aids (HAs).\nMETHOD: Twenty young adult HA users and 20 controls were recruited for the study. Participants were asked to stand on a force plate using computerized dynamic posturography and perform a Sensory Organization Test (SOT) as a balance task under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. The DT condition involved performing a visual cognitive task (Backward Digit Recall) while maintaining balance. Balance performance was measured using equilibrium scores under four different conditions.\nRESULTS: The results showed that SOT scores of HA users decreased significantly in the DT compared to the ST (\np\nof Condition 1: < .001;\np\nof Condition 4: < .001;\np\nof Condition 6: = .001). HA users' SOT scores in the DT condition were statistically significantly lower than controls (\np\nof Condition 1: < .003;\np\nof Condition 4: < .009;\np\nof Condition 6: = .004). This suggests that the presence of a visual cognitive additional task has a negative impact on balance performance in young adults with HAs.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of cognitive tasks on balance performance in young adults with HAs. Further studies should investigate the specific needs of hearing loss patients in multitasking conditions, including age, degree of hearing loss, and cognitive ability, to develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of falls.\nPMID:\n39018264\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00530",

Epub 2024 Jul 17.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Linguistic prosody is affected in Parkinson's disease (PD), which implicates the basal ganglia's role in the production of prosody. However, there is no recent systematic synthesis of the available acoustic evidence of prosodic impairment in PD. This study aimed to identify the acoustic features of linguistic prosody that are consistently affected in PD.\nMETHOD: The authors systematically reviewed articles that reported acoustic features of prosodic production in PD. Articles focused on fundamental frequency (\nF\n0) and its variability, intensity and its variability, speech and articulation rate, and pause duration and ratio. From a total of 648 records identified, 36 met criteria for inclusion and exclusion. For each acoustic measurement and task, data from people with PD (PwPD) were compared with those from controls to extract effect sizes. Pooled effect sizes were estimated using robust Bayesian hierarchical regression models.\nRESULTS: PD was associated with decreased\nF\n0 variability and increased pause duration. There was limited evidence of reduced intensity variability and speech rate in PwPD. No evidence was found to suggest that PD affects articulation rate or pause ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: The primary acoustic parameters of prosody affected by PD are\nF\n0 variability and pause duration. The identification of these acoustic parameters has important clinical implications for the selection of PD management strategies. The association of\nF\n0 variability and pause duration with PD suggests that the neural circuits controlling these parameters are at least partly shared and might include the basal ganglia. While the current study focused on the phonetic realization of prosodic cues, future studies should examine whether and how PD affects prosody at higher levels of processing.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25892923.\nPMID:\n39018262\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00588",

Epub 2024 Jul 17.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This study examines the accuracy of Interaction Detection in Early Childhood Settings (IDEAS), a program that automatically transcribes audio files and estimates linguistic units relevant to speech-language therapy, including part-of-speech units that represent features of language complexity, such as adjectives and coordinating conjunctions.\nMETHOD: Forty-five video-recorded speech-language therapy sessions involving 27 speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and 56 children were used. The\nF\nmeasure determines the accuracy of IDEAS diarization (i.e., speech segmentation and speaker classification). Two additional evaluation metrics, namely, median absolute relative error and correlation, indicate the accuracy of IDEAS for the estimation of linguistic units as compared with two conditions, namely, Oracle (manual diarization) and Voice Type Classifier (existing diarizer with acceptable accuracy).\nRESULTS: The high\nF\nmeasure for SLP talk data suggests high accuracy of IDEAS diarization for SLP talk but less so for child talk. These differences are reflected in the accuracy of IDEAS linguistic unit estimates. IDEAS median absolute relative error and correlation values for nine of the 10 SLP linguistic unit estimates meet the accuracy criteria, but none of the child linguistic unit estimates meet these criteria. The type of linguistic units also affects IDEAS accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: IDEAS was tailored to educational settings to automatically convert audio recordings into text and to provide linguistic unit estimates in speech-language therapy sessions and classroom settings. Although not perfect, IDEAS is reliable in automatically capturing and returning linguistic units, especially in SLP talk, that are relevant in research and practice. The tool offers a way to automatically measure SLP talk in clinical settings, which will support research seeking to understand how SLP talk influences children's language growth.\nPMID:\n39018260\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00310",

This qualitative study describes the experiences of families of first- and second-grade children with DLD during the pandemic as compared to the experiences of families of typically developing (TD) peers.\nMETHOD: A conventional content analysis approach was used to analyze caregivers' written responses to open-ended questions regarding their perceptions of COVID-19 educational disruptions. Responses were analyzed separately by group: caregivers of children with DLD (\nn\n= 23) and caregivers of TD children (\nn\n= 22).\nRESULTS: Four categories of caregiver responses were generated for each group: impacts on children, remote learning challenges, impacts on caregivers, and protective factors. For both groups, concerns about the child's well-being and literacy learning were most prevalent and prevailed over concerns about oral language. Most caregivers in each group described negative impacts of educational disruptions on their cdhildren. As compared to caregivers of TD children, caregivers of children with DLD reported higher rates of remote learning challenges and more negative impacts on literacy learning, speech and/or language, and education in general. DLD caregivers also shared fewer positive comments and remarks related to protective factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that families of children with DLD may have experienced more challenges during COVID-19 educational disruptions as compared to families of TD peers. Thus, responsive research and supports for these families is essential.\nPMID:\n39028568\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00181",

Auditory training could mitigate these auditory difficulties. However, few auditory training programs have been designed to target specific listening deficits for students with ASD. The present study summarizes the development of an innovative, one-on-one, clinician-developed speech-in-noise (SIN) training program that has not been previously described and an existing dichotic auditory training program to address common auditory processing deficits in students with ASD.\nMETHOD: Twenty verbal students with ASD, ages 7-17 years, completed a one-on-one, clinician-developed SIN training program and a commercially available dichotic training program 2-3 times a week (30-45 min per session) for 12 weeks. Maximum and minimum training levels from the SIN and dichotic training programs were analyzed statistically to document changes in training level over the training period.\nRESULTS: Analyses of the pre- and posttraining data revealed significant improvements in training level for both the SIN and dichotic training programs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the proposed SIN training resulted in significant improvements in training level and may be used along with dichotic training to improve some of the most common auditory processing issues documented in verbal individuals with ASD requiring minimal support. Both types of auditory training may be implemented in one-on-one therapy in clinics and in the schools.\nPMID:\n39008496\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00168",

Narratives were elicited in SL/Hebrew using the wordless picture book,\nFrog, Where Are You?\nNarratives were transcribed and coded for frequency of ISTs and classified as perceptual, linguistic, motivational, linguistic, emotional, or physical. ISTs were also examined in terms of their role in microstructure (tokens and types) and macrostructure (Character, Setting, Initiating Event, Internal Response, Plan, Attempt, and Consequence) categories.\nRESULTS: In terms of microstructure, bilingual children with DLD produced fewer word types and tokens in general and fewer perceptual ISTs than bilingual TLD peers. In terms of macrostructure, children with DLD used six out of the seven story grammar elements in their narratives less than bilinguals with TLD. For ISTs and macrostructure, bilinguals with DLD produced fewer linguistic ISTs in Attempts than their peers with TLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bilingual children with DLD have difficulties in producing ISTs, and this difficulty is shown to be related to both microstructure and macrostructure abilities. Suggestions for clinical intervention are offered to assist children with DLD in producing narratives that involve mental state language related to characters' feelings, intentions, and goals.\nPMID:\n38913847\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00170",

Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and promise of a writing intervention for fourth- and fifth-grade students with LLD (WILLD: writing in students with LLD). The intervention components included word-, sentence-, and discourse-level writing processes and instructional practices using self-regulation strategies.\nMETHOD: Participants for this study were 15 students with LLD, recruited from three different schools. Students' writing was assessed using a sentence probe task and obtaining an informative paragraph writing sample as a measure of proximal writing outcomes. Trained speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and special educators delivered the intervention in a small-group format over 12 weeks. Using a within-group pre-post design, we examined changes in writing outcomes before and after the intervention.\nRESULTS: Results indicated that the intervention helped students improve their informative writing skills; students' writing quality showed a statistically significant increase, and grammatical errors showed a significant decrease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this pilot effort indicates that WILLD was feasible and appears to show promise for improving writing outcomes for fourth- and fifth-grade students with LLD when delivered by SLPs and special educators in a small-group format. Implications of the results and directions for future research are discussed.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26053132.\nPMID:\n38901005\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00187",

Treatment was carried out over 12 sessions with approximately two sessions per week. Maintenance sessions were conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks postintervention. Participants were explicitly taught story grammar elements, causal and temporal connections, and modifiers within story retells and personal narratives. Dependent variables were story grammar, grammatical complexity, modifiers and listening comprehension within story retells, and story grammar and grammatical complexity within personal narratives. Outcome measures were assessed at the end of every baseline, intervention, and maintenance session using the Narrative Language Measures-Listening (NLM-L).\nRESULTS: Visual analyses for outcome measures suggested slight increases in scores on the NLM-L during intervention accompanied by marked variability. Within-case analyses of story retell performance suggested an intervention effect on story grammar for two participants and on grammatical complexity and modifier use for one participant. For personal narratives, within-case analyses of personal narrative performance suggested an intervention effect on story grammar for one participant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall,\nStory Champs\ndemonstrated efficacy for improving story grammar use in story retells for three out of four participants.

Epub 2024 Jun 19.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: We investigated the effectiveness of a highly individualized morphosyntactic intervention using the SHAPE CODING™ system delivered at different dosages.\nMETHOD: Eight children with developmental language disorder aged 8;0-10;10 (years;months) received 10 hr of explicit individualized intervention for morphosyntax delivered in 30-min individual sessions once per week for 20 weeks. Following at least four baseline probe tests, two grammatical targets per session received explicit instruction until they reached criterion (90%), when the next target was introduced. To control for session length and teaching episode density, either both targets received 20 teaching episodes per session or one target received 10 teaching episodes and the other 30. Maintenance testing of completed targets was also carried out.\nRESULTS: Scores on probe tests post-intervention were significantly higher than during the baseline phase (\nd\n= 1.6) with no change during the baseline or maintenance phases. However, progress during the intervention phase was highly significant. One participant showed significantly faster progress with intervention, while one (with the lowest attention score) made little progress. When considering progress relative to cumulative intervention sessions, progress was faster with 30 teaching episodes per session and slower with 10. However, when cumulative teaching episodes were used as the predictor, all three within-session dosages showed very similar rates of progress, with the odds of a correct response increasing by 3.9% for each teaching episode. The targets that were achieved required an average of 40-60 teaching episodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the exception of one participant, the individualized intervention was highly effective and efficient. Thus, the individualized target identification process and intervention method merit further research in a larger group of children. The cumulative number of teaching episodes per target provided across sessions appeared to be key. Thus, clinicians should aim for high teaching episode rates, particularly if the number of sessions is constrained. Otherwise, intervention scheduling can be flexible.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25996168.\nPMID:\n38896880\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00098",

Epub 2024 Jun 18.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: We investigated and compared the outcomes from two standardized, norm-referenced screening assessments of language (i.e., Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool-Second Edition [CELFP-2], Diagnostic Evaluation of Language Variation-Screening Test [DELV-ST]) with African American preschoolers whose spoken dialect differed from that of General American English (GAE). We (a) described preschoolers' performance on the CELFP-2 Core Language Index (CLI) and its subtests with consideration of degree of dialect variation (DVAR) observed, (b) investigated how the application of dialect-sensitive scoring modifications to the expressive morphology and syntax Word Structure (WS) subtest affected CELFP-2 CLI scores, and (c) evaluated the screening classification agreement rates between the DELV-ST and the CELFP-2 CLI.\nMETHOD: African American preschoolers (\nN\n= 284) completed the CELFP-2 CLI subtests (i.e., Sentence Structure, WS, Expressive Vocabulary) and the DELV-ST. Density of spoken dialect use was estimated with the DELV-ST Part I Language Variation Status, and percentage of DVAR was calculated. The CELFP-2 WS subtest was scored with and without dialect-sensitive scoring modifications.\nRESULTS: Planned comparisons of CELFP-2 CLI performance indicated statistically significant differences in performance based on DELV-ST-determined degree of language variation groupings. Scoring modifications applied to the WS subtest increased subtest scaled scores and CLI composite standard scores. However, preschoolers who demonstrated strong variation from GAE continued to demonstrate significantly lower performance than preschoolers who demonstrated little to no language variation. Affected-status agreement rates between assessments (modified and unmodified CELFP-2 CLI scores and DELV-ST Part II Diagnostic Risk Status) were extremely low.\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of dialect-specific scoring modifications to standardized, norm-referenced assessments of language must be simultaneously viewed through the lenses of equity, practicality, and psychometry. The results of our multistage study reiterate the need for reliable methods of identifying risk for developmental language disorder within children who speak American English dialects other than GAE.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26017978.\nPMID:\n38889198\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00134",

Growth curve models captured within- and between-individual change in article accuracy from the beginning of preschool to the end of first grade.\nRESULTS: As a group, DLLs did not exhibit significant positive or negative growth in Spanish article accuracy over time. On average, article accuracy remained stable at 76% from preschool throughout first grade. Participants exhibited significant variability in article accuracy that was partly explained by changes in Spanish proficiency. Spanish article accuracy was lower for DLLs with lower Spanish proficiency indexed by measures from the Spanish language samples, while English proficiency indexed by the English language samples did not affect Spanish article accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that expectations for Spanish grammatical performance in DLLs need to be adjusted to account for the possible impact of not receiving Spanish support in English immersion school settings. DLLs in these instructional programs do not exhibit article accuracy at a level expected for monolingual Spanish speakers. Significant individual differences in both individual status and growth rates of Spanish article accuracy highlight the broad variability in Spanish language skills of DLLs in the United States.\nPMID:\n38843435\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00202",

In contrast, there is presently no consensus regarding methods for the written documentation of sign language samples. The Handshape Analysis Recording Tool (HART) is an innovative method for documenting and analyzing word level samples of signed languages in real time. Fluent sign language users can document the expressive sign productions of children to gather data on sign use and accuracy.\nMETHOD: The HART was developed to document children's productions in Australian Sign Language (Auslan) in a bilingual-bicultural educational program for the Deaf in Australia. This written method was piloted with a group of fluent signing Deaf educational staff in 2014-2016, then used in 2022-2023 with a group of fluent signing professionals to examine inter- and intrarater reliability when coding parameters of sign accuracy.\nRESULTS: Interrater reliability measured by Gwet's Agreement Coefficient, was \"good\" to \"very good\" across the four phonological parameters that are components of every sign: location, movement, handshape, and orientation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that the HART can be a reliable tool for coding the accuracy of location, orientation, movement, and handshape parameters of Auslan phonology when used by professionals fluent in Auslan. The HART can be utilized with any sign language to gather word level sign language samples in a written form and document the phonological accuracy of signed productions.\nPMID:\n38843410\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00189",

Reduced shared reading has been documented among families of caregiver(s) with language-based learning disabilities (LBLD). Yet, it remains unclear whether caregivers' history of language and reading difficulties is associated with caregiver self-efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine whether self-efficacy in language- and reading-related caregiver activities related to caregiver history of language and reading difficulties and shared reading practices.\nMETHOD: One hundred seventy-six caregivers of children aged 18-60 months completed a custom self-efficacy in language- and reading-related caregiver activities questionnaire, as well as demographic, history of language and reading difficulties (used both as a continuous measure and to dichotomize caregivers with and without LBLD history), and shared reading measures in a one-time survey.\nRESULTS: Caregivers with a history of LBLD reported an overall lower self-efficacy and a reduced amount of time reading with their children per week than caregivers without LBLD history. Examining caregiver history of language and reading difficulties continuously across the whole group, self-efficacy mediated the relationship between caregiver difficulties and shared reading practices, even when caregiver education was incorporated as an additional mediator in models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that self-efficacy and caregiver education mediate the relationship between caregiver history of language and reading difficulties and shared reading practices. Consideration of self-efficacy by clinicians and educators is warranted when promoting shared reading practices to caregivers of young children. There is a need for future research to examine relationships between self-efficacy and shared reading among caregivers with LBLD of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25901590.\nPMID:\n38820226\n| PMC:\nPMC11253799\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00067",

These articles were subjected to rigorous evaluation for inclusion criteria, specifically focusing on their reporting of speech or auditory perception using psychoacoustic tasks. The selected studies exclusively examined school-age children, encompassing those between 5 and 18 years of age. Following rigorous evaluation, 10 articles meeting these criteria were selected for inclusion in the review.\nRESULTS: The analysis of included articles consistently shows that even slight hearing loss in school-age children significantly affects their speech and auditory perception. Notably, most of the included articles highlighted a common trend, demonstrating that perceptual deficits originating due to slight hearing loss in children are particularly observable under challenging experimental conditions and/or in cognitively demanding listening tasks. Recent evidence further underscores that the negative impacts of slight hearing loss in school-age children cannot be solely predicted by their pure-tone thresholds alone. However, there is limited evidence concerning the effect of slight hearing loss on the segregation of competing speech, which may be a better representation of listening in the classroom.\nCONCLUSION: This scoping review discusses the perceptual consequences of slight hearing loss in school-age children and provides insights into an array of methodological issues associated with studying perceptual skills in school-age children with slight hearing losses, offering guidance for future research endeavors.\nPMID:\n38787321\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00165",

It is therefore important for teachers to be able to assess children's language skills, especially if they are concerned about their learning. We report the development and standardization of a mobile app-LanguageScreen-that can be used by education professionals to assess children's language ability.\nMETHOD: The standardization sample included data from approximately 350,000 children aged 3;06 (years;months) to 8;11 who were screened for receptive and expressive language skills using LanguageScreen. Rasch scaling was used to select items of appropriate difficulty on a single unidimensional scale.\nRESULTS: LanguageScreen has excellent psychometric properties, including high reliability, good fit to the Rasch model, and minimal differential item functioning across key student groups. Girls outperformed boys, and children with English as an additional language scored less well compared to monolingual English speakers.\nCONCLUSIONS: LanguageScreen provides an easy-to-use, reliable, child-friendly means of identifying children with language difficulties.

Some transcribe these clauses as two separate utterances, whereas others conjoin them within a single utterance. As an inquiry into equitable practice, we examined rates of conjoined independent clauses produced by children and the impact of separating these clauses within utterances on measures of mean length of utterance (MLU) by a child's English dialect, clinical status, and age.\nMETHOD: The data were archival and included 246 language samples from children classified by their dialect (African American English or Southern White English) and clinical status (developmental language disorder [DLD] or typically developing [TD]), with those in the TD group further classified by their age (4 years [TD4] or 6 years [TD6]).\nRESULTS: Rates of conjoined independent clauses and the impact of these clauses on MLU varied by clinical status (DLD < TD) and age (TD4 < TD6), but not by dialect. Correlations between the rate of conjoined clauses, MLU, and language test scores were also similar across the two dialects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Transcription decisions regarding conjoined independent clauses within language samples lead to equitable measurement outcomes across dialects of English. Nevertheless, transcribing conjoined independent clauses as two separate utterances reduces one's ability to detect syntactic differences between children with and without DLD and document syntactic growth as children age.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25822675.\nPMID:\n38758707\n| PMC:\nPMC11253809\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00180",

Participants included 273 English-speaking kindergarten through second-grade children with language impairment receiving business-as-usual therapy on the caseloads of 75 speech-language pathologists. Data were collected over an academic year, including weekly therapy logs, speech-language pathology questionnaires, and pre- and post-language measures.\nRESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed that children primarily experienced small-group therapy sessions (two to four children); however, there was considerable variability in group size. Hierarchical general linear modeling indicated that caseload size did not explain group size variability. However, the number of student cancellations was positively associated with receipt of large-group sessions. Notably, a significant negative association was found between receipt of large-group sessions (i.e., five to 10 children) and language outcomes. Children who received more than the average number of sessions in large groups (i.e., more than 5% of total sessions) experienced 0.18\nSD\nless language gain over the academic year compared to the mean (0.54\nSD\n). No other group size configurations (i.e., individual, small group, and extra large) yielded significant associations with language outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that young children receiving language-based therapy in large groups make substantially fewer language gains over an academic year. These results have considerable implications for educational policy and clinical practice, which are discussed through an implementation science frame.\nPMID:\n38748997\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00047",

Discourse elicitation and analysis provides the opportunity for such an evaluation to occur. In this article, our overall aim was to describe adolescents' language performance on four elicitation tasks and determine if there are task-related differences across the elicitation tasks.\nMETHOD: Forty-four typically developing adolescents with ages ranging from 12;2 to 17;11 (years;months;\nM =\n15;2; 21 boys and 23 girls) participated in the study. They completed four spoken discourse tasks: (a) story generation using a wordless picture book, (b) fable retell, (c) six personal narratives in response to emotion-based prompts, and (d) monologic response to two stories that contained a moral dilemma. Responses were transcribed and analyzed for four language performance measures tapping into language productivity, syntactic complexity, lexical diversity, and verbal facility.\nRESULTS: Despite individual variability in performance, mean scores were close to median scores for most measures, suggesting a symmetrical distribution. As expected, all four language performance measures were significantly different across the four elicitation tasks. The personal narrative task elicited the longest samples, with the highest verbal fluency. In contrast, both lexical diversity and syntactic complexity were the strongest in response to the fable retell and the moral dilemma tasks.\nCONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides speech-language pathologists with an overview of how task-related factors may impact adolescent language performance. These findings may be used to support their clinical decision-making processes in choosing a suitable discourse task when conducting a comprehensive spoken language assessment. Three hypothetical case examples are used to illustrate the decision-making process.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25761768.\nPMID:\n38748925\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00163",

The mechanisms underlying this association are not yet fully understood, especially in individuals without a known specific otologic disorder. In particular, only scarce information on the combined occurrence of audiovestibular sensory impairment is available so far. Therefore, this study aims to provide further insight into the prevalence and co-prevalence of the audiovestibular symptoms hearing loss, tinnitus and dizziness. Additionally, the influence of potential risk factors from lifestyle habits as well as cardiovascular and metabolic conditions on the development of those symptoms is studied. Data was analyzed from 8134 individuals from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). SHIP pursues a broad and comprehensive examination program in chronologically separated cohorts with longitudinal follow-up. Cohorts are sampled from Western Pomerania, a rural region of north-eastern Germany. The study population represents a cross-sectional analysis from the cohorts SHIP-START (recruited 1997-2001) and SHIP-TREND (recruited 2008-2012), sampled for baseline investigations (SHIP-START-0 and SHIP-TREND-0) at the age of 20-79 years. Audiovestibular symptoms as outcome variables were assessed by structured questionnaires. Additionally, individuals were comprehensively characterized regarding modifiable lifestyle factors as well as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, allowing the assessment of their role as exposure variables. We calculated a weighted prevalence of 14.2% for hearing loss, 9.7% for tinnitus, and 13.5% for dizziness in the population. Prevalence increased with age and differed among the sexes. A considerable share of 28.0% of the investigated individuals reported more than one symptom at once. The prevalence of hearing loss as well as tinnitus increased between the two cohorts. A moderate positive correlation was found between the occurrence of hearing loss and tinnitus (phi-coefficient 0.318). In multivariable regression analyses, education was identified as a significant protective factor while only smoking was significantly associated with all three symptoms. Furthermore, several cardiovascular risk factors contributed to both hearing loss and dizziness. In conclusion, audiovestibular symptoms are highly prevalent in the investigated population. A considerable but complex influence of risk factors points towards a relation with neuronal as well as cardiovascular disease processes. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, the interaction between the senses of hearing and balance as well as the mode of action of the risk factors should be evaluated in more detail in the future.\nPMID:\n39085387\n| PMC:\nPMC11291685\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-68577-3",

We conducted a prospective cohort study with 16 patients who had bilateral hearing loss and received unilateral CI. Based on the surgical side, patients were categorized into left and right CI groups. Volumetric T1-weighted brain MRI were obtained before and one year after the surgery. To overcome the artifact caused by the internal device in post-CI scan, image reconstruction method was newly devised and applied using the contralateral hemisphere of the pre-CI MRI data, to run FreeSurfer. We conducted within-subject template estimation for unbiased longitudinal image analysis, based on the linear mixed effect models. When analyzing the contralateral cerebral hemisphere before and after CI, a substantial increase in superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus (STG) volumes was observed in the left CI group. A positive correlation was observed in the STG and post-CI word recognition score in both groups. As far as we know, this is the first study attempting longitudinal brain volumetry based on post-CI MRI scans.

Considering the continued perpetration and visibility of racism online and in the news, vicarious racism, or \"secondhand\" racism when hearing about or witnessing racism being committed against members of one's ethnic or racial group, is a particularly urgent threat in the context of such disparities and their subsequent health consequences. The current study examines if frequency of exposure to vicarious racism and the emotional impact of those experiences are linked to psychoactive substance use, and explores the role of ethnic identity in moderating these relationships. In a cross-sectional survey, 504 adult participants aged 18-78 (M age = 30.15, SD = 11.52, 52.6% female) identifying as Black/African American or Latine reported on their experiences with vicarious racism and alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use over the past 30 days. Logistic regression was utilized to test hypotheses. Primary findings indicate that greater emotional impact of vicarious racism was associated with a 50% increase in odds of alcohol consumption and that ethnic identity moderated the association between vicarious racism and marijuana use. Greater emotional impact of vicarious racism was related to more marijuana use for those lower on ethnic identity, whereas there was no association for those higher on ethnic identity. Vicarious racism was not related to tobacco use. Results suggest that ethnic identity might be protective in the association of vicarious racism on substance use. Further research on this topic is needed as vicarious racism becomes an increasingly common experience among marginalized populations.\nPMID:\n39060300\n| PMC:\nPMC11282253\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-67202-7",

For deaf signers who experience changes in visual attention and have little or no access to the sounds of the language they read, understanding the visual constraints underlying reading is crucial. This study aims to explore a fundamental aspect of visual perception intertwined with reading: the crowding effect. This effect manifests as the struggle to distinguish a target letter when surrounded by flanker letters. Through a two-alternative forced choice task, we assessed the recognition of letters and symbols presented in isolation or flanked by two or four characters, positioned either to the left or right of fixation. Our findings reveal that while deaf individuals exhibit higher accuracy in processing letters compared to symbols, their performance falls short of that of their hearing counterparts. Interestingly, despite their proficiency with letters, deaf individuals didn't demonstrate quicker letter identification, particularly in the most challenging scenario where letters were flanked by four characters. These outcomes imply the development of a specialized letter processing system among deaf individuals, albeit one that may subtly diverge from that of their hearing counterparts.\nPMID:\n38997432\n| PMC:\nPMC11245469\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66832-1",

Inner hair cells act as primary mechanoelectrical transducers, while outer hair cells enhance sound-induced vibrations within the organ of Corti. Established inner ear damage models, such as systemic administration of ototoxic aminoglycosides, yield inconsistent and variable hair cell death in mice. Overcoming this limitation, we developed a method involving surgical delivery of a hyperosmotic sisomicin solution into the posterior semicircular canal of adult mice. This procedure induced rapid and synchronous apoptotic demise of outer hair cells within 14 h, leading to irreversible hearing loss. The combination of sisomicin and hyperosmotic stress caused consistent and synergistic ototoxic damage. Inner hair cells remained until three days post-treatment, after which deterioration in structure and number was observed, culminating in a complete hair cell loss by day seven.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the health of older adults. However, less is known about the characteristics of ED visits by older adults with HD during the pandemic. This study examines the association between self-reported HD severity and ED visits during the pandemic. This population-based cross-sectional study used self-reported data on HD and the characteristics of respondents aged 65 years or older from three cycles of the National Health Interview Survey from 2020 to 2022. Data were analysed from February 23, 2023, to March 22, 2023. The primary outcome was self-reported ED visits in the past 12 months. This study employed generalised linear models to examine the relationship between ED visits (dependent variable) and HD in older adults, and the effect sizes were expressed as rate ratios. Key independent variables included the reasons for ED visit. Covariates such as demographic characteristics and socio-economic status were controlled for to account for potential confounding effects. During the pandemic, older adults with HD commonly visited the ED because of chronic pain (82.8%), frailty (77.9%), trouble falling/staying asleep (73.2%), hypertension (67.4%), and arthritis (60.1%), all of which were 1.5-times more likely in these adults than in those with normal hearing (chronic pain: adjusted rate ratio [ARR], 1.64 [95% CI 1.44-1.93]; frailty: ARR, 1.57 [95% CI 1.16-1.87]; trouble falling/staying asleep: ARR, 1.51 [95% CI 1.21-1.82]; hypertension: ARR, 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.23]; arthritis: ARR, 1.39 [95% CI 1.31-1.57]. Older adults with HD were more likely to visit the ED for chronic pain, frailty, trouble falling/staying asleep, hypertension, and arthritis than those with normal hearing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to explore the impact of age-related hearing loss in the extended high frequency (EHF) range above 8 kHz on individuals' subjective discomfort towards dental drill noise. After measuring pure-tone audiometric thresholds at both conventional and extended high frequencies, we used a psychoacoustic approach to evaluate subjective impressions of four dental drill sound stimuli, which featured varying frequency components, in 62 participants (aged 12-67 years). We found a significant decrease in hearing sensitivity within the EHF range as age increased, with notable differences in hearing thresholds at 14 kHz between teenage and older adults exceeding 65 dB. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between younger and older (above 40 years) participants in the subjective impressions of dental drill noise, emphasizing age as a critical factor in the perception of high frequency components. Consequently, age may influence the unpleasantness of dental drilling noise. Compared to older individuals, young participants may exhibit increased fear of dental procedures owing to physiological factors. These results underscore the need for age-appropriate noise control strategies in dental clinics to mitigate anxiety and improve patient comfort.\nPMID:\n38977724\n| PMC:\nPMC11231262\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-65429-y",

To investigate these questions, we constructed predictive and correlational models, which utilize mean surprisals from LLMs as predictor variables. Using AphasiaBank archived data, we validated our models' efficacy in aphasia diagnosis, measurement, and prediction. Our finding is that LLMs-surprisals can effectively detect the presence of aphasia and different natures of the disorder, LLMs in conjunction with the existing language indices improve models' efficacy in subtyping aphasia, and LLMs-surprisals can capture common agrammatic deficits at both word and sentence level.

We previously reported that HK-2, an orally active, multifunctional redox modulator (MFRM), was highly effective in reducing both hearing loss and hair cells loss in rats exposed to a moderate intensity workday noise that likely damages the cochlea primarily from oxidative stress versus direct mechanical trauma. To determine if HK-2 could also protect cochlear and vestibular cells from damage caused primarily from direct blast-induced mechanical trauma versus oxidative stress, we exposed rats to six blasts of 186 dB peak SPL. The rats were divided into four groups: (B) blast alone, (BEP) blast plus earplugs, (BHK-2) blast plus HK-2 and (BEPHK-2) blast plus earplugs plus HK-2. HK-2 was orally administered at 50 mg/kg/d from 7-days before to 30-day after the blast exposure. Cochlear and vestibular tissues were harvested 60-d post-exposure and evaluated for loss of outer hair cells (OHC), inner hair cells (IHC), auditory nerve fibers (ANF), spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and vestibular hair cells in the saccule, utricle and semicircular canals. In the untreated blast-exposed group (B), massive losses occurred to OHC, IHC, ANF, SGN and only the vestibular hair cells in the striola region of the saccule. In contrast, rats treated with HK-2 (BHK-2) sustained significantly less OHC (67%) and IHC (57%) loss compared to the B group. OHC and IHC losses were smallest in the BEPHK-2 group, but not significantly different from the BEP group indicating lack of protective synergy between EP and HK-2. There was no loss of ANF, SGN or saccular hair cells in the BHK-2, BEP and BEPHK-2 groups. Thus, HK-2 not only significantly reduced OHC and IHC damage, but completely prevented loss of ANF, SGN and saccule hair cells. The powerful protective effects of this oral MFRM make HK-2 an extremely promising candidate for human clinical trials.\nPMID:\n38961203\n| PMC:\nPMC11222375\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66406-1",

To investigate the role of KCNQ4 in the vestibular organ, 6-g hypergravity stimulation for 24 h, which represents excessive mechanical stimulation of the sensory epithelium, was applied to p.W277S Kcnq4 transgenic mice.

In this strategy, the amplitude envelope is extracted from several audio frequency bands and used to modulate the amplitude of a set of vibro-tactile tones. The vocoder strategy allows good consonant discrimination, but vowel discrimination is poor and the strategy is susceptible to background noise. In the current study, we assessed whether multi-band amplitude envelope expansion can effectively enhance critical vowel features, such as formants, and improve speech extraction from noise. In 32 participants with normal touch perception, tactile-only phoneme discrimination with and without envelope expansion was assessed both in quiet and in background noise. Envelope expansion improved performance in quiet by 10.3% for vowels and by 5.9% for consonants. In noise, envelope expansion improved overall phoneme discrimination by 9.6%, with no difference in benefit between consonants and vowels. The tactile vocoder with envelope expansion can be deployed in real-time on a compact device and could substantially improve clinical outcomes for a new generation of haptic hearing aids.\nPMID:\n38951556\n| PMC:\nPMC11217272\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-65510-6",

Depression is a common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability. Here, We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach using pooled statistics from genome-wide association studies of ISSHL (1491 cases, 196,592 controls) and depression (23,424 cases, 192,220 controls) in European populations. This study investigated the bidirectional relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with depression and ISSHL using inverse variance weighting.Additional sensitivity analyses, such as Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger), weighted median estimates, and leave-one-out analysis, were performed to assess the reliability of the findings. Significant causal association between genetic susceptibility to ISSHL and depression in a random-effects IVW approach (OR = 1.037, 95% CI = 1.004-1.072, P = 0.030). In contrast, genetic depression was not risk factors for ISSHL (OR = 1.134, 95% CI = 0.871-1.475, P = 0.350). After validation by different MR methods and the sensitivity analysis, all of the above results are consistent. The evidence we have gathered suggests a causal relationship between ISSHL and depression. The presence of the former induces or further exacerbates the latter, whereas a similar situation does not exist when the latter is an influencing factor.\nPMID:\n38942925\n| PMC:\nPMC11213911\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-65966-6",
