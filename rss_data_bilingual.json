Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Evidence continues to emerge of associations between cochlear implant (CI) outcomes and cognitive functions in postlingually deafened adults. While there are multiple factors that appear to affect these associations, the impact of speech recognition background testing conditions (i.e., in quiet versus noise) has not been systematically explored. The two aims of this study were to (1) identify associations between speech recognition following cochlear implantation and performance on cognitive tasks, and to (2) investigate the impact of speech testing in quiet versus noise on these associations. Ultimately, we want to understand the conditions that impact this complex relationship between CI outcomes and cognition.\nDESIGN: A scoping review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was performed on published literature evaluating the relation between outcomes of cochlear implantation and cognition. The current review evaluates 39 papers that reported associations between over 30 cognitive assessments and speech recognition tests in adult patients with CIs. Six cognitive domains were evaluated: Global Cognition, Inhibition-Concentration, Memory and Learning, Controlled Fluency, Verbal Fluency, and Visuospatial Organization. Meta-analysis was conducted on three cognitive assessments among 12 studies to evaluate relations with speech recognition outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify whether speech recognition testing in quiet versus in background noise impacted its association with cognitive performance.\nRESULTS: Significant associations between cognition and speech recognition in a background of quiet or noise were found in 69% of studies. Tests of Global Cognition and Inhibition-Concentration skills resulted in the highest overall frequency of significant associations with speech recognition (45% and 57%, respectively). Despite the modest proportion of significant associations reported, pooling effect sizes across samples through meta-analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between tests of Global Cognition (r = +0.37, p < 0.01) as well as Verbal Fluency (r = +0.44, p < 0.01) and postoperative speech recognition skills. Tests of Memory and Learning are most frequently utilized in the setting of CI (in 26 of 39 included studies), yet meta-analysis revealed nonsignificant associations with speech recognition performance in a background of quiet (r = +0.30, p = 0.18), and noise (r = -0.06, p = 0.78).\nCONCLUSIONS: Background conditions of speech recognition testing may influence the relation between speech recognition outcomes and cognition. The magnitude of this effect of testing conditions on this relationship appears to vary depending on the cognitive construct being assessed. Overall, Global Cognition and Inhibition-Concentration skills are potentially useful in explaining speech recognition skills following cochlear implantation. Future work should continue to evaluate these relations to appropriately unify cognitive testing opportunities in the setting of cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38953851\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001527",

However, no consensus exists on which tests constitute the minimum necessary battery. We assembled an international panel of clinical experts to develop, refine, and vote upon a set of core consensus statements.\nDESIGN: A literature review was used to identify intraoperative tests currently used in the field and draft a set of provisional statements. For statement evaluation and refinement, we used a modified Delphi consensus panel structure. Multiple interactive rounds of voting, evaluation, and feedback were conducted to achieve convergence.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine provisional statements were included in the original draft. In the first voting round, consensus was reached on 15 statements. Of the 14 statements that did not reach consensus, 12 were revised based on feedback provided by the expert practitioners, and 2 were eliminated. In the second voting round, 10 of the 12 revised statements reached a consensus. The two statements which did not achieve consensus were further revised and subjected to a third voting round. However, both statements failed to achieve consensus in the third round. In addition, during the final revision, one more statement was decided to be deleted due to overlap with another modified statement.\nCONCLUSIONS: A final core set of 24 consensus statements was generated, covering wide areas of intraoperative testing during CI surgery. These statements may provide utility as evidence-based guidelines to improve quality and achieve uniformity of surgical practice.\nPMID:\n38915137\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001526",

Children with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing, hearing aid evaluation, or cochlear implant mapping at our tertiary pediatric medical center between January 2018 and December 2021 were included. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify social, demographic, and health factors associated with primary outcomes, defined as age at hearing loss identification, age at intervention (here defined as amplification start), and interval between identification and intervention.\nRESULTS: Of 132 patients included, mean age was 2.4 years, 48% were male, and 51% were Hispanic. There was significant association between each Hispanic ethnicity (p = 0.005, p = 0.04, respectively), insurance type (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively), and later age at identification and intervention. In multivariable analyses, Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with both delays in identification and intervention (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively), and public insurance was associated with delays in intervention (p = 0.01). In addition, the total number of ABRs was significantly associated with both older age of identification and intervention (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Mediator analysis demonstrated that the effect of ethnicity on age at identification is mediated by the total number of ABRs performed.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant association between total number of ABRs and age at identification and intervention for children with hearing loss exists. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with delays in meeting milestones, further mediated by the number of ABRs, providing a potential avenue for intervention in addressing this disparity.\nPMID:\n38898551\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001534",

This investigation draws on hearing data from 5 to 13 years and again at 45 years of age, to explore the associations between childhood hearing variables and hearing and listening ability at age 45.\nDESIGN: Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between childhood hearing (otological status and mid-frequency pure-tone average) and (a) age 45 peripheral hearing ability (mid-frequency pure-tone average and high-frequency pure-tone average), and (b) age 45 listening ability (listening in spatialized noise and subjective questionnaire on listening experiences). Sex, childhood socioeconomic status, and adult IQ were included in the model as covariates.\nRESULTS: Peripheral hearing and listening abilities at age 45 were consistently associated with childhood hearing acuity at mid-frequencies. Otological status was a moderate predicting factor for high-frequency hearing and utilization of spatial listening cues in adulthood.\nCONCLUSIONS: We aim to use these findings to develop a foundational model of hearing trajectories. This will form the basis for identifying precursors, to be investigated in a subsequent series of analyses, that may protect against or exacerbate hearing-associated cognitive decline in the Dunedin Study cohort as they progress from mid-life to older age.\nPMID:\n38898547\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001542",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: We investigated whether listening effort is dependent on task difficulty for cochlear implant (CI) users when using the Matrix speech-in-noise test. To this end, we measured peak pupil dilation (PPD) at a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNR) by systematically changing the noise level at a constant speech level, and vice versa.\nDESIGN: A group of mostly elderly CI users performed the Dutch/Flemish Matrix test in quiet and in multitalker babble at different SNRs. SNRs were set relative to the speech-recognition threshold (SRT), namely at SRT, and 5 and 10 dB above SRT (0 dB, +5 dB, and +10 dB re SRT). The latter 2 conditions were obtained by either varying speech level (at a fixed noise level of 60 dBA) or by varying noise level (with a fixed speech level). We compared these PPDs with those of a group of typical hearing (TH) listeners. In addition, listening effort was assessed with subjective ratings on a Likert scale.\nRESULTS: PPD for the CI group did not significantly depend on SNR, whereas SNR significantly affected PPDs for TH listeners. Subjective effort ratings depended significantly on SNR for both groups. For CI users, PPDs were significantly larger, and effort was rated higher when speech was varied, and noise was fixed for CI users. By contrast, for TH listeners effort ratings were significantly higher and performance scores lower when noise was varied, and speech was fixed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of a significant effect of varying SNR on PPD suggests that the Matrix test may not be a feasible speech test for measuring listening effort with pupillometric measures for CI users. A rating test appeared more promising in this population, corroborating earlier reports that subjective measures may reflect different dimensions of listening effort than pupil dilation. Establishing the SNR by varying speech or noise level can have subtle, but significant effects on measures of listening effort, and these effects can differ between TH listeners and CI users.\nPMID:\n38886888\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001529",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: In clinical and laboratory settings, speech recognition is typically assessed in a way that cannot distinguish accurate auditory perception from misperception that was mentally repaired or inferred from context. Previous work showed that the process of repairing misperceptions elicits greater listening effort, and that this elevated effort lingers well after the sentence is heard. That result suggests that cognitive repair strategies might appear successful when testing a single utterance but fail for everyday continuous conversational speech. The present study tested the hypothesis that the effort of repairing misperceptions has the consequence of carrying over to interfere with perception of later words after the sentence.\nDESIGN: Stimuli were open-set coherent sentences that were presented intact or with a word early in the sentence replaced with noise, forcing the listener to use later context to mentally repair the missing word. Sentences were immediately followed by digit triplets, which served to probe carryover effort from the sentence. Control conditions allowed for the comparison to intact sentences that did not demand mental repair, as well as to listening conditions that removed the need to attend to the post-sentence stimuli, or removed the post-sentence digits altogether. Intelligibility scores for the sentences and digits were accompanied by time-series measurements of pupil dilation to assess cognitive load during the task, as well as subjective rating of effort. Participants included adults with cochlear implants (CIs), as well as an age-matched group and a younger group of listeners with typical hearing for comparison.\nRESULTS: For the CI group, needing to repair a missing word during a sentence resulted in more errors on the digits after the sentence, especially when the repair process did not result in a coherent sensible perception. Sentences that needed repair also contained more errors on the words that were unmasked. All groups showed substantial increase of pupil dilation when sentences required repair, even when the repair was successful. Younger typical hearing listeners showed clear differences in moment-to-moment allocation of effort in the different conditions, while the other groups did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: For CI listeners, the effort of needing to repair misperceptions in a sentence can last long enough to interfere with words that follow the sentence. This pattern could pose a serious problem for regular communication but would go overlooked in typical testing with single utterances, where a listener has a chance to repair misperceptions before responding. Carryover effort was not predictable by basic intelligibility scores, but can be revealed in behavioral data when sentences are followed immediately by extra probe words such as digits.\nPMID:\n38886880\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001537",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Recently, the Noise-Tolerance Domains Test (NTDT) was applied to study the noise-tolerance domains used by young normal-hearing (NH) listeners during noise acceptance decisions. In this study, we examined how subjective speech intelligibility may drive noise acceptance decisions by applying the NTDT on NH and hearing-impaired (HI) listeners at the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) around the Tracking of Noise-Tolerance (TNT) thresholds.\nDESIGN: A single-blind, within-subjects design with 22 NH and 17 HI older adults was followed. Listeners completed the TNT to determine the average noise acceptance threshold (TNTAve). Then, listeners completed the NTDT at the SNRs of 0, ±3 dB (re: TNTAve) to estimate the weighted noise-tolerance domain ratings (WNTDRs) for each domain criterion. Listeners also completed the Objective and Subjective Intelligibility Difference (OSID) Test to establish the individual intelligibility performance-intensity (P-I) functions of the TNT materials. All test measures were conducted at 75 and 82 dB SPL speech input levels. NH and HI listeners were tested in the unaided mode. The HI listeners were also tested using a study hearing aid. The WNTDRs were plotted against subjective speech intelligibilities extrapolated from individual P-I of the OSID at the SNRs corresponding to NTDT test conditions. Listeners were grouped according to their most heavily weighed domain and a regression analysis was performed against listener demographics as well as TNT and OSID performances to determine which variable(s) affected listener grouping.\nRESULTS: Three linear mixed effects (LMEs) models were used to examine whether WNTDRs changed with subjective speech intelligibility. All three LMEs found significant fixed effects of domain criteria, subjective intelligibility, and speech input level on WNTDRs. In general, heavier weights were assigned to speech interference and loudness domains at poorer intelligibility levels (<50%) with reversals to distraction and annoyance at higher intelligibility levels (>80%). The comparison between NH and HI-unaided showed that NH listeners assigned greater weights to loudness than the HI-unaided listeners. The comparison between NH and HI-aided groups showed similar weights between groups. The comparison between HI-unaided and HI-aided found that HI listeners assigned lower weights to speech interference and greater weights to loudness when tested in aided compared with unaided modes. In all comparisons, loudness was weighed heavier at the 82 dB SPL input level than at the 75 dB SPL input level with greater weights to annoyance in the NH versus HI-unaided comparison and lower weights to distraction in the HI-aided versus HI-unaided comparison. A generalized linear model determined that listener grouping was best accounted for by subjective speech intelligibility estimated at TNTAve.\nCONCLUSIONS: The domain criteria used by listeners were driven by their subjective speech intelligibility regardless of their hearing status (i.e., NH versus HI). In general, when subjective intelligibility was poor, the domains of speech interference and loudness were weighed the heaviest. As subjective intelligibility improved, the weightings on annoyance and distraction increased. Furthermore, a listener's criterion for >90% subjective speech understanding at the TNTAve may allow one to profile the listener.\nPMID:\n38880961\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001536",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Listening effort involves the mental effort required to perceive an auditory stimulus, for example in noisy environments. Prolonged increased listening effort, for example due to impaired hearing ability, may increase risk of health complications. It is therefore important to identify valid and sensitive measures of listening effort. Physiological measures have been shown to be sensitive to auditory task demand manipulations and are considered to reflect changes in listening effort. Such measures include pupil dilation, alpha power, skin conductance level, and heart rate variability. The aim of the current systematic review was to provide an overview of studies to listening effort that used multiple physiological measures. The two main questions were: (1) what is the effect of changes in auditory task demand on simultaneously acquired physiological measures from various modalities? and (2) what is the relationship between the responses in these physiological measures?\nDESIGN: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, relevant articles were sought in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science and by examining the references of included articles. Search iterations with different combinations of psychophysiological measures were performed in conjunction with listening effort-related search terms. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies.\nRESULTS: A total of 297 articles were identified from three databases, of which 27 were included. One additional article was identified from reference lists. Of the total 28 included articles, 16 included an analysis regarding the relationship between the physiological measures. The overall quality of the included studies was reasonable.\nCONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that most of the physiological measures either show no effect to auditory task demand manipulations or a consistent effect in the expected direction. For example, pupil dilation increased, pre-ejection period decreased, and skin conductance level increased with increasing auditory task demand. Most of the relationships between the responses of these physiological measures were nonsignificant or weak. The physiological measures varied in their sensitivity to auditory task demand manipulations. One of the identified knowledge gaps was that the included studies mostly used tasks with high-performance levels, resulting in an underrepresentation of the physiological changes at lower performance levels. This makes it difficult to capture how the physiological responses behave across the full psychometric curve. Our results support the Framework for Understanding Effortful Listening and the need for a multimodal approach to listening effort. We furthermore discuss focus points for future studies.\nPMID:\n38880960\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001508",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Modern cochlear implants (CIs) use varying-length electrode arrays inserted at varying insertion angles within variably sized cochleae. Thus, there exists an opportunity to enhance CI performance, particularly in postlinguistic adults, by optimizing the frequency-to-place allocation for electrical stimulation, thereby minimizing the need for central adaptation and plasticity. There has been interest in applying Greenwood or Stakhovskaya et al. function (describing the tonotopic map) to postoperative imaging of electrodes to improve frequency allocation and place coding. Acoustically-evoked electrocochleography (ECochG) allows for electrophysiologic best-frequency (BF) determination of CI electrodes and the potential for creating a personalized frequency allocation function. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between early speech-perception performance and frequency-to-place mismatch.\nDESIGN: This retrospective study included 50 patients who received a slim perimodiolar electrode array. Following electrode insertion, five acoustic pure-tone stimuli ranging from 0.25 to 2 kHz were presented, and electrophysiological measurements were collected across all 22 electrode contacts. Cochlear microphonic tuning curves were subsequently generated for each stimulus frequency to ascertain the BF electrode or the location corresponding to the maximum response amplitude. Subsequently, we calculated the difference between the stimulus frequency and the patient's CI map's actual frequency allocation at each BF electrode, reflecting the frequency-to-place mismatch. BF electrocochleography-total response (BF-ECochG-TR), a measure of cochlear health, was also evaluated for each subject to control for the known impact of this measure on performance.\nRESULTS: Our findings showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.23 to 0.76) between the cumulative frequency-to-place mismatch, as determined using the ECochG-derived BF map (utilizing 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), and 3-month performance on consonant-nucleus-consonant words (N = 38). Larger positive mismatches, shifted basal from the BF map, led to enhanced speech perception. Incorporating BF-ECochG-TR, total mismatch, and their interaction in a multivariate model explained 62% of the variance in consonant-nucleus-consonant word scores at 3 months. BF-ECochG-TR as a standalone predictor tended to overestimate performance for subjects with larger negative total mismatches and underestimated the performance for those with larger positive total mismatches. Neither cochlear diameter, number of cochlear turns, nor apical insertion angle accounted for the variability in total mismatch.\nCONCLUSIONS: Comparison of ECochG-BF derived tonotopic electrode maps to the frequency allocation tables reveals substantial mismatch, explaining 26.0% of the variability in CI performance in quiet. Closer examination of the mismatch shows that basally shifted maps at high frequencies demonstrate superior performance at 3 months compared with those with apically shifted maps (toward Greenwood and Stakhovskaya et al.). The implications of these results suggest that electrophysiological-based frequency reallocation might lead to enhanced speech-perception performance, especially when compared with conventional manufacturer maps or anatomic-based mapping strategies. Future research, exploring the prospective use of ECochG-based mapping techniques for frequency allocation is underway.\nPMID:\n38880958\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001528",

In particular, linguistic context allows the use of several cognitive mechanisms that are not well distinguished in hearing science, namely those relating to \"postdiction\", \"integration\", and \"prediction\". We offer the perspective that an unacknowledged impact of hearing loss is the differential use of predictive mechanisms relative to age-matched individuals with normal hearing. As evidence, we first review how degraded auditory input leads to reduced prediction in people with normal hearing, then consider the literature exploring context use in people with acquired postlingual hearing loss. We argue that no research on hearing loss has directly assessed prediction. Because current interventions for hearing do not fully alleviate difficulty in conversation, and avoidance of spoken social interaction may be a mediator between hearing loss and cognitive decline, this perspective could lead to greater understanding of cognitive effects of hearing loss and provide insight regarding new targets for intervention.\nPMID:\n38880953\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001515",

A total of 105 participants with moderate-to-profound hearing loss (HL) and 54 with normal hearing were enrolled in the validation process.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Recently, the HEAR-aware app was developed to support adults who are eligible for hearing aids (HAs) but not yet ready to use them. The app serves as a self-management tool, offering assistance for a range of target behaviors (TBs), such as communication strategies and emotional coping. Using ecological momentary assessment and intervention, the app prompts users to complete brief surveys regarding challenging listening situations they encounter in their daily lives (ecological momentary assessment). In response, users receive educational content in the form of \"snippets\" (videos, texts, web links) on the TBs, some of which are customized based on the reported acoustic environmental characteristics (ecological momentary intervention). The primary objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the HEAR-aware app in enhancing readiness to take action on various TBs and evaluate its impact on secondary outcomes. The secondary objective was to examine the app's usability, usefulness, and user satisfaction.\nMETHODS: A randomized controlled trial design with two arms was used. Participants with hearing loss aged 50 years and over were recruited via an HA retailer and randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 42, mean age = 65 years [SD = 9.1]) or the control group (n = 45, mean age = 68 years [SD 8.7]). The intervention group used the app during 4 weeks. The control group received no intervention. All participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), and again 4 weeks later (T2). Participants' readiness to take action on five TBs was measured with The Line Composite. A list of secondary outcomes was used. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using Linear Mixed effect Models including group (intervention/control), time (T0/T1/T2), and Group × Time Interactions. In addition, a per protocol analysis was carried out to explore whether effects depended on app usage. For the secondary aim the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, item 4 of the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Intervention (IOI-AI), and a recommendation item were used (intervention group only at T1).\nRESULTS: For objective 1, there was no significant group difference for The Line Composite over the course of T0, T1, and T2. However, a significant (p = 0.033) Group × Time Interaction was found for The Line Emotional coping, with higher increase in readiness to take action on emotional coping in the intervention group than in the control group. The intention-to-treat analyses revealed no other significant group differences, but the per protocol analyses showed that participants in the intervention group were significantly more ready to take up Assistive Listening Devices (The Line Assistive Listening Devices) and less ready to take up HAs (Staging Algorithm HAs) than the control group (p = 0.049). Results for objective 2 showed that on average, participants rated the app as moderately useful (mean Intrinsic Motivation Inventory score 5 out of 7) and its usability as \"marginal\" (mean SUS score 68 out of 100) with about half of the participants rating the app as \"good\" (SUS score >70) and a minority rating is as \"unacceptable\" (SUS score ≤50).\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of self-management support tools like the HEAR-aware app in the rehabilitation of adults with hearing loss who are not yet ready for HAs. The range in usability scores suggest that it may not be a suitable intervention for everyone.\nPMID:\n38831480\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001533",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Speech recognition in cochlear implant (CI) recipients is quite variable, particularly in challenging listening conditions. Demographic, audiological, and cognitive factors explain some, but not all, of this variance. The literature suggests that rapid auditory perceptual learning explains unique variance in speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and those with hearing loss. The present study focuses on the early adaptation phase of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning. It investigates whether adult CI recipients exhibit this learning and, if so, whether it accounts for portions of the variance in their recognition of fast speech and speech in noise.\nDESIGN: Thirty-six adult CI recipients (ages = 35 to 77, M = 55) completed a battery of general speech recognition tests (sentences in speech-shaped noise, four-talker babble noise, and natural-fast speech), cognitive measures (vocabulary, working memory, attention, and verbal processing speed), and a rapid auditory perceptual learning task with time-compressed speech. Accuracy in the general speech recognition tasks was modeled with a series of generalized mixed models that accounted for demographic, audiological, and cognitive factors before accounting for the contribution of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning of time-compressed speech.\nRESULTS: Most CI recipients exhibited early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning of time-compressed speech within the course of the first 20 sentences. This early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning had unique contribution to the recognition of natural-fast speech in quiet and speech in noise, although the contribution to natural-fast speech may reflect the rapid learning that occurred in this task. When accounting for demographic and cognitive characteristics, an increase of 1 SD in the early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning rate was associated with ~52% increase in the odds of correctly recognizing natural-fast speech in quiet, and ~19% to 28% in the odds of correctly recognizing the different types of speech in noise. Age, vocabulary, attention, and verbal processing speed also had unique contributions to general speech recognition. However, their contribution varied between the different general speech recognition tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous findings in other populations, in CI recipients, early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual, learning also accounts for some of the individual differences in the recognition of speech in noise and natural-fast speech in quiet. Thus, across populations, the early rapid adaptation phase of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning might serve as a skill that supports speech recognition in various adverse conditions. In CI users, the ability to rapidly adapt to ongoing acoustical challenges may be one of the factors associated with good CI outcomes. Overall, CI recipients with higher cognitive resources and faster rapid learning rates had better speech recognition.\nPMID:\n38829780\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001523",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Objective estimation of minimum hearing levels using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) elicited by single frequency tone-bursts presented monaurally is currently considered the gold standard. However, the data acquisition time to estimate thresholds (for both ears across four audiometric frequencies) using this method usually exceeds the sleep time (ranging between 35 and 49 minutes) in infants below 4 months, thus providing incomplete information of hearing status which in turn delays timely clinical intervention. Alternate approaches using faster rate, or tone-burst trains have not been readily accepted due to additional hardware and software requirements. We propose here a novel binaural multifrequency stimulation paradigm wherein several stimuli of different frequencies are presented binaurally in an interleaved manner. The rationale here is that the proposed paradigm will increase acquisition efficiency, significantly reduce test time, and improve accuracy by incorporating an automatic wave V detection algorithm. It is important to note that this paradigm can be easily implemented in most commercial ABR systems currently used by most clinicians.\nDESIGN: Using this binaural multifrequency paradigm, ear specific ABRs were recorded in 30 normal-hearing young adults to both tone-bursts, and narrow-band (NB) iChirps at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Comparison of ABRs elicited by tone-bursts and narrow-band chirps allowed us to determine if NB iChirps elicited a more robust wave V component compared with the tone-bursts. ABR data were characterized by measures of minimum hearing levels; wave V amplitude; and response detectability for two electrode configurations (high forehead-C7; and high forehead-linked mastoids).\nRESULTS: Consistent with the research literature, wave V response amplitudes were relatively more robust for NB iChirp stimuli compared with tone-burst stimuli. The easier identification and better detectability of wave V for the NB iChirps at lower stimulus levels contributed to their better thresholds compared with tone-burst elicited responses. It is important to note that binaural multifrequency hearing levels close to minimum hearing levels were determined in approximately 22 minutes using this paradigm-appreciably quicker than the 45 to 60 minutes or longer time required for threshold determination using the conventional single frequency method.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel and simple paradigm using either NB iChirps or tone-bursts provides a reliable method to rapidly estimate the minimum hearing levels across audiometric frequencies for both ears. Incorporation of an automatic wave V detection algorithm increases objectivity and further reduce test time and facilitate early hearing identification and intervention.\nPMID:\n38825740\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001535",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Assessing listening difficulties and associated complaints can be challenging. Often, measures of peripheral auditory functions are within normal ranges, making clinicians feel unsure about proper management strategies. The range and nature of observed or experienced difficulties might be better captured using a qualitative measure. The Evaluation of Children's Listening and Processing Skills (ECLiPS) questionnaire was designed to broadly profile the auditory and cognitive problems often present in children with listening difficulties. This 38-item questionnaire was initially standardized in British children aged 6 to 11 years, was subsequently modified for use with North-American children, and was recently translated into Flemish-Dutch. This study aimed to compare typical scores of the Flemish version with the UK and US versions, and to evaluate and compare its psychometric quality based on Rasch analysis.\nDESIGN: We selected 112 Flemish children aged 6 to 11 years with verified normal hearing and typical development, and asked two caregivers of every child to fill out the ECLiPS. Data from two comparator samples were analyzed, including responses for 71 North-American children and 650 British children. Typical values for ECLiPS factors and aggregates were determined as a function of age and gender, and meaningful differences across samples were analyzed. Rasch analyses were performed to evaluate whether ECLiPS response categories work as intended, and whether item scores fit a linear equal interval measurement scale that works the same way for everyone. Item and person metrics were derived, including separation and reliability indices. We investigated whether items function similarly across linguistically and culturally different samples.\nRESULTS: ECLiPS scores were relatively invariant to age. Girls obtained higher scores compared with boys, mainly for items related to memory and attention, and pragmatic and social skills. Across ECLiPS versions, the most pronounced differences were found for items probing social skills. With respect to its psychometric quality, ECLiPS response categories work as intended, and ECLiPS items were found to fit the Rasch measurement scale. Cultural differences in responses were noted for some items, belonging to different factors. Item separation and reliability indices generally pointed toward sufficient variation in item difficulty. In general, person separation (and reliability) metrics, quantifying the instrument's ability to distinguish between poor and strong performers (in a reproducible manner), were low. This is expected from samples of typically developing children with homogeneous and high levels of listening ability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Across the languages assessed here, the ECLiPS caregiver questionnaire was verified to be a psychometrically valid qualitative measure to assess listening and processing skills, which can be used to support the assessment and management of elementary school children referred with LiD.\nPMID:\n38825739\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001509",

Results of pure-tone audiometry and immittance measures are also presented. Nationally representative datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 2011 to 2012, 2015 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, the three most recent NHANES datasets with audiological information, were used.\nRESULTS: The NHANES datasets indicated that there are 49.5 million adults in the United States with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing trouble. Results indicated that OTC hearing-aid candidates are most frequently 50 to 69 years of age, married, and identify as non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity. Most of these individuals graduated from high school, had several risk factors for hearing loss, had not had a hearing test in the past 5 years, and had never used hearing aids or assistive listening devices previously. The typical audiometric profile was a bilaterally symmetrical sloping hearing loss with slight to mild hearing loss above 2000 Hz. Group data showed normal immittance measures and absence of otoscopic abnormalities except for the presence of excessive (not impacted) cerumen in about 13% of the OTC hearing-aid candidates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tens of millions of US adults have perceived mild-to-moderate hearing trouble but have not pursued assistance, either through obtaining a hearing test or acquiring prescription hearing aids.\nPMID:\n38816904\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001514",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nFollowing adult-onset hearing impairment, crossmodal plasticity can occur within various sensory cortices, often characterized by increased neural responses to visual stimulation in not only the auditory cortex, but also in the visual and audiovisual cortices. In the present study, we used an established model of loud noise exposure in rats to examine, for the first time, whether the crossmodal plasticity in the audiovisual cortex that occurs following a relatively mild degree of hearing loss emerges solely from altered intracortical processing or if thalamocortical changes also contribute to the crossmodal effects. Using a combination of an established pharmacological 'cortical silencing' protocol and current source density analysis of the laminar activity recorded across the layers of the audiovisual cortex (i.e., the lateral extrastriate visual cortex, V2L), we observed layer-specific changes post-silencing in the strength of the residual visual, but not auditory, input in the noise exposed rats with mild hearing loss compared to rats with normal hearing. Furthermore, based on a comparison of the laminar profiles pre- versus post-silencing in both groups, we can conclude that noise exposure caused a re-allocation of the strength of visual inputs across the layers of the V2L cortex, including enhanced visual-evoked activity in the granular layer; findings consistent with thalamocortical plasticity. Finally, we confirmed that audiovisual integration within the V2L cortex depends on intact processing within intracortical circuits, and that this form of multisensory processing is vulnerable to disruption by noise-induced hearing loss. Ultimately, the present study furthers our understanding of the contribution of intracortical and thalamocortical processing to crossmodal plasticity as well as to audiovisual integration under both normal and mildly-impaired hearing conditions.\nPMID:\n38941694\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109071",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND & RATIONALE: In prior work using non-speech stimuli, children with hearing loss show impaired perception of binaural cues and no significant change in cortical responses to bilateral versus unilateral stimulation. Aims of the present study were to: 1) identify bilateral responses to envelope and spectral components of a speech syllable using the frequency-following response (FFR), 2) determine if abnormalities in the bilateral FFR occur in children with hearing loss, and 3) assess functional consequences of abnormal bilateral FFR responses on perception of binaural timing cues.\nMETHODS: A single-syllable speech stimulus (/dα/) was presented to each ear individually and bilaterally. Participants were 9 children with normal hearing (M\nAge\n= 12.1 ± 2.5 years) and 6 children with bilateral hearing loss who were experienced bilateral hearing aid users (M\nAge\n= 14.0 ± 2.6 years). FFR temporal and spectral peak amplitudes were compared between listening conditions and groups using linear mixed model regression analyses. Behavioral sensitivity to binaural cues were measured by lateralization responses as coming from the right or left side of the head.\nRESULTS: Both temporal and spectral peaks in FFR responses increased in amplitude in the bilateral compared to unilateral listening conditions in children with normal hearing. These measures of \"bilateral advantage\" were reduced in the group of children with bilateral hearing loss and associated with decreased sensitivity to interaural timing differences.\nCONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that bilateral responses in both temporal and spectral domains can be measured in children using the FFR and is altered in children with hearing loss with consequences to binaural hearing.\nPMID:\n38936172\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109068",

Currently 20 % of the world's population suffer from a form of hearing impairment; this is predicted to rise to 25 % by 2050. Despite this staggering disease load, and the vast damage it inflicts on the social, medical and economic fabric of humankind, our ability to predict, or prevent, the loss of hearing is very poor indeed. We here make the case for a paradigm shift in our approach to studying deafness. By exploiting more forcefully the molecular-genetic conservation between human hearing and hearing in morphologically distinct models, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we believe, a deeper understanding of hearing and deafness can be achieved. An understanding that moves beyond the surface of the 'deafness genes' to probe the underlying bedrock of hearing, which is shared across taxa, and partly shared across modalities. When it comes to understanding the workings (and failings) of human sensory function, a simple fruit fly has a lot to offer and a fly eye might sometimes be a powerful model for a human ear. Particularly the use of fly avatars, in which specific molecular (genetic or proteomic) states of humans (e.g. specific patients) are experimentally reproduced, in order to study the corresponding molecular mechanisms (e.g. specific diseases) in a controlled yet naturalistic environment, is a tool that promises multiple unprecedented insights. The use of the fly - and fly avatars - would benefit humans and will help enhance the power of other scientific models, such as the mouse.\nPMID:\n38896942\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109047",

However, studies with interaural phase modulation of pure tones showed that IC neurons have a sensitivity to changes in ITD that is not present at the level of the brainstem. This sensitivity has been interpreted as a form of sensitivity to motion. A new type of stimulus is used here to study the sensitivity of IC neurons to dynamic changes in ITD, in which broad- or narrowband stimuli are swept through a range of ITDs with arbitrary start-ITD, end-ITD, speed, and direction. Extracellular recordings were obtained under barbiturate anesthesia in the cat. We applied the same analyses as previously introduced for the study of responses to tones. We find effects of motion which are similar to those described in response to interaural phase modulation of tones. The size of the effects strongly depended on the motion parameters but was overall smaller than reported for tones. We found that the effects of motion could largely be explained by the temporal response pattern of the neuron such as adaptation and build-up. Our data add to previous evidence questioning true coding of motion at the level of the IC.\nPMID:\n38889563\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109066",

These demands for rapid adaptation tax the information processing speed ability of children who receive cochlear implants. This study investigated the association of speed of information processing ability with spoken language outcomes after cochlear implantation in prelingually deaf children aged 4-6 years. Two domain-general (visual, non-linguistic) speed of information processing measures were administered to 21 preschool-aged children with cochlear implants and 23 normal-hearing peers. Measures of speech recognition, language (vocabulary and comprehension), nonverbal intelligence, and executive functioning skills were also obtained from each participant. Speed of information processing was positively associated with speech recognition and language skills in preschool-aged children with cochlear implants but not in normal-hearing peers. This association remained significant after controlling for hearing group, age, nonverbal intelligence, and executive functioning skills. These findings are consistent with models suggesting that domain-general, fast-efficient information processing speed underlies adaptation to speech perception and language learning following implantation. Assessment and intervention strategies targeting speed of information processing may provide better understanding and development of speech-language skills after cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38889562\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109069",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe study aimed to explore the auditory temporal resolution and dichotic listening skills in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and identify associated health-related factors. Using a cross-sectional design, 87 adults with T2DM and 48 non-diabetic controls, all with normal hearing, participated. The two central auditory processing (CAP) skills were assessed through the Gaps-In-Noise (GIN) and Dichotic-Digits Listening (DDL) tests. T2DM participants underwent blood tests to measure various health-related factors. In the GIN test, the shortest gap threshold (GapTh) obtained across both ears was significantly higher in the diabetic group (9.1 ± 2.4 ms) compared to the non-diabetic group (7.5 ± 1.5 ms), and the score of correctly identified gaps (GapSc) in the diabetic group (45±11 %) was significantly lower than GapSc in the non-diabetic group (52±9 %), p < 0.001. In the DDL test, the free-recall score (73.8 ± 18.5 %) across both ears and the right-ear advantage (-1.3 ± 20.6 %) in the diabetic group were significantly lower than the free-recall score (85.8 ± 11.9 %) and right-ear advantage (6.9 ± 11.9 %) in the non-diabetic group, p < 0.005. Furthermore, the duration of diabetes, eGFR level, retinopathy, carotid plaque, fasting blood glucose level, and HDL-C (good cholesterol) level were factors significantly associated with performances in the GIN and/or DDL tests for T2DM participants. In conclusion, individuals with T2DM are at risk of reduced auditory processing skills in temporal resolution and dichotic listening, impacting their speech understanding. Six health-related factors were identified as significantly associated with CAP skills in T2DM patients.\nPMID:\n38870778\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109067",

The present investigation delves into the contribution of the Mfsd2a molecule, integral to the structural and functional integrity of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), to the ontogeny and sustenance of the BLB. Our empirical findings delineate that the maturation of the BLB in murine models is not realized until approximately two weeks post-birth, with preceding stages characterized by notable permeability. Transcriptomic analysis elucidates a marked augmentation in Mfsd2a expression within the lateral wall of the cochlea in specimens exhibiting an intact BLB. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo assays substantiate that a diminution in Mfsd2a expression detrimentally impacts BLB permeability and structural integrity, principally via the attenuation of tight junction protein expression and the enhancement of endothelial cell transcytosis. These insights underscore the indispensable role of Mfsd2a in ensuring BLB integrity and propose it as a viable target for therapeutic interventions aimed at the amelioration of hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38852535\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109048",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nSince the presence of tinnitus is not always associated with audiometric hearing loss, it has been hypothesized that hidden hearing loss may act as a potential trigger for increased central gain along the neural pathway leading to tinnitus perception. In recent years, the study of hidden hearing loss has improved with the discovery of cochlear synaptopathy and several objective diagnostic markers. This study investigated three potential markers of peripheral hidden hearing loss in subjects with tinnitus: extended high-frequency audiometric thresholds, the auditory brainstem response, and the envelope following response. In addition, speech intelligibility was measured as a functional outcome measurement of hidden hearing loss. To account for age-related hidden hearing loss, participants were grouped according to age, presence of tinnitus, and audiometric thresholds. Group comparisons were conducted to differentiate between age- and tinnitus-related effects of hidden hearing loss. All three markers revealed age-related differences, whereas no differences were observed between the tinnitus and non-tinnitus groups. However, the older tinnitus group showed improved performance on low-pass filtered speech in noise tests compared to the older non-tinnitus group. These low-pass speech in noise scores were significantly correlated with tinnitus distress, as indicated using questionnaires, and could be related to the presence of hyperacusis. Based on our observations, cochlear synaptopathy does not appear to be the underlying cause of tinnitus. The improvement in low-pass speech-in-noise could be explained by enhanced temporal fine structure encoding or hyperacusis. Therefore, we recommend that future tinnitus research takes into account age-related factors, explores low-frequency encoding, and thoroughly assesses hyperacusis.\nPMID:\n38852534\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109050",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe round window (RW) membrane plays an important role in normal inner ear mechanics. Occlusion or reinforcement of the RW has been described in the context of congenital anomalies or after cochlear implantation and is applied as a surgical treatment for hyperacusis. Multiple lumped and finite element models predict a low-frequency hearing loss with air conduction of up to 20 dB after RW reinforcement and limited to no effect on hearing with bone conduction stimulation. Experimental verification of these results, however, remains limited. Here, we present an experimental study measuring the impact of RW reinforcement on the middle and inner ear mechanics with air and bone conduction stimulation. In a within-specimen repeated measures design with human cadaveric specimens (n = 6), we compared the intracochlear pressures in scala vestibuli (P\nSV\n) and scala tympani (P\nST\n) before and after RW reinforcement with soft tissue, cartilage, and bone cement. The differential pressure (P\nDIFF\n) across the basilar membrane - known to be closely related to the hearing sensation - was calculated as the complex difference between P\nSV\nand P\nST\n. With air conduction stimulation, both P\nSV\nand P\nST\nincreased on average up to 22 dB at frequencies below 1500 Hz with larger effect sizes for P\nST\ncompared to P\nSV\n. The P\nDIFF\n, in contrast, decreased up to 11 dB at frequencies between 700 and 800 Hz after reinforcement with bone cement. With bone conduction, the average within-specimen effects were less than 5 dB for either P\nSV\n, P\nST,\nor P\nDIFF\n. The inter-specimen variability with bone conduction, however, was considerably larger than with air conduction. This experimental study shows that RW reinforcement impacts air conduction stimulation at low frequencies. Bone conduction stimulation seems to be largely unaffected. From a clinical point of view, these results support the hypothesis that delayed loss of air conduction hearing after cochlear implantation could be partially explained by the impact of RW reinforcement.\nPMID:\n38850830\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109049",

In vivo, the cochlea of aged mice showed higher miR-130b-3p expression and lower PPARγ expression, while exogenous inhibition of miR-130b-3p up-regulated PPARγ expression. Autophagy-related biomarkers expression (ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3B II/I) decreased in aged mice, which reversely increased after the inhibition of miR-130b-3p.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of tinnitus, there are limited options for effective treatment. Tinnitus treatments are made more complicated by the lack of a test for tinnitus based on objectively measured physiological characteristics. Such an objective test would enable a greater understanding of tinnitus mechanisms and may lead to faster treatment development in both animal and human research. This review makes the argument that an objective tinnitus test, such as a non-invasive electrophysiological measure, is desperately needed. We review the current tinnitus assessment methods, the underlying neural correlates of tinnitus, the multiple tinnitus generation theories, and the previously investigated electrophysiological measurements of tinnitus. Finally, we propose an alternate objective test for tinnitus that may be valid in both animal and human subjects.\nPMID:\n38810373\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109046",

Epub 2024 May 25.\nABSTRACT\nAlthough rats and mice are among the preferred animal models for investigating many characteristics of auditory function, they are rarely used to study an essential aspect of binaural hearing: the ability of animals to localize the sources of low-frequency sounds by detecting the interaural time difference (ITD), that is the difference in the time at which the sound arrives at each ear. In mammals, ITDs are mostly encoded in the medial superior olive (MSO), one of the main nuclei of the superior olivary complex (SOC). Because of their small heads and high frequency hearing range, rats and mice are often considered unable to use ITDs for sound localization. Moreover, their MSO is frequently viewed as too small or insignificant compared to that of mammals that use ITDs to localize sounds, including cats and gerbils. However, recent research has demonstrated remarkable similarities between most morphological and physiological features of mouse MSO neurons and those of MSO neurons of mammals that use ITDs. In this context, we have analyzed the structure and neural afferent and efferent connections of the rat MSO, which had never been studied by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into the nucleus. The rat MSO spans the SOC longitudinally. It is relatively small caudally, but grows rostrally into a well-developed column of stacked bipolar neurons. By placing small, precise injections of the bidirectional tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the MSO, we show that this nucleus is innervated mainly by the most ventral and rostral spherical bushy cells of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus of both sides, and by the most ventrolateral principal neurons of the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. The same experiments reveal that the MSO densely innervates the most dorsolateral region of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, the central region of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and the most lateral region of the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus of its own side. Therefore, the MSO is selectively innervated by, and sends projections to, neurons that process low-frequency sounds. The structural and hodological features of the rat MSO are notably similar to those of the MSO of cats and gerbils. While these similarities raise the question of what functions other than ITD coding the MSO performs, they also suggest that the rat MSO is an appropriate model for future MSO-centered research.\nPMID:\n38797037\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109036",

Impairment of inner ear functions is the main cause of hearing loss. In aged individuals, not only inner ear dysfunction but also senescence of the central nervous system is the cause of malfunction of the auditory system. In most cases of hearing loss, the activity of the auditory nerve is reduced, but that of the successive auditory centers is increased in a compensatory way. It has been reported that activity changes occur in the inferior colliculus (IC), a critical nexus of the auditory pathway. The IC integrates the inputs from the brainstem and drives the higher auditory centers. Since abnormal activity in the IC is likely to affect auditory perception, it is crucial to elucidate the neuronal mechanism to induce the activity changes of IC neurons with hearing loss. This review outlines recent findings on hearing-loss-induced plastic changes in the IC and brainstem auditory neuronal circuits and discusses what neuronal mechanisms underlie hearing-loss-induced changes in the activity of IC neurons. Considering the different causes of hearing loss, we discuss age-related hearing loss separately from other forms of hearing loss (non-age-related hearing loss). In general, the main plastic change of IC neurons caused by both age-related and non-age-related hearing loss is increased central gain. However, plastic changes in the IC caused by age-related hearing loss seem to be more complex than those caused by non-age-related hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38797036\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109033",

This creates the representation of perceptual objects from sensory features. Oscillatory activity can be differentiated into stimulus-phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced). The former is mainly determined by sensory input, the latter by higher-level (cortical) processing. Effects of auditory deprivation on cortical oscillations have been studied in congenitally deaf cats (CDCs) using cochlear implant (CI) stimulation. CI-induced alpha, beta, and gamma activity were compromised in the auditory cortex of CDCs. Furthermore, top-down information flow between secondary and primary auditory areas in hearing cats, conveyed by induced alpha oscillations, was lost in CDCs. Here we used the matching pursuit algorithm to assess components of such oscillatory activity in local field potentials recorded in primary field A1. Additionally to the loss of induced alpha oscillations, we also found a loss of evoked theta activity in CDCs. The loss of theta and alpha activity in CDCs can be directly related to reduced high-frequency (gamma-band) activity due to cross-frequency coupling. Here we quantified such cross-frequency coupling in adult 1) hearing-experienced, acoustically stimulated cats (aHCs), 2) hearing-experienced cats following acute pharmacological deafening and subsequent CIs, thus in electrically stimulated cats (eHCs), and 3) electrically stimulated CDCs. We found significant cross-frequency coupling in all animal groups in > 70% of auditory-responsive sites. The predominant coupling in aHCs and eHCs was between theta/alpha phase and gamma power. In CDCs such coupling was lost and replaced by alpha oscillations coupling to delta/theta phase. Thus, alpha/theta oscillations synchronize high-frequency gamma activity only in hearing-experienced cats. The absence of induced alpha and theta oscillations contributes to the loss of induced gamma power in CDCs, thereby signifying impaired local network activity.\nPMID:\n38797035\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109032",

Here, we investigated aging effects on perception and neural representation of the consonant transition and the factors that contribute to successful perception. To further understand the neural mechanisms underlying the changes in processing from brainstem to cortex, we also examined the factors that contribute to exaggerated amplitudes in cortex. We enrolled 30 younger normal-hearing and 30 older normal-hearing participants who met the criteria of clinically normal hearing. Perceptual identification functions were obtained for the words BEAT and WHEAT on a 7-step continuum of consonant-transition duration. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded to click stimuli and frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical auditory-evoked potentials were recorded to the endpoints of the BEAT-WHEAT continuum. Perceptual performance for identification of BEAT vs. WHEAT did not differ between younger and older listeners. However, both subcortical and cortical measures of neural representation showed age group differences, such that FFR phase locking was lower but cortical amplitudes (P1 and N1) were higher in older compared to younger listeners. ABR Wave I amplitude and FFR phase locking, but not audiometric thresholds, predicted early cortical amplitudes. Phase locking to the transition region and early cortical peak amplitudes (P1) predicted performance on the perceptual identification function. Overall, results suggest that the neural representation of transition durations and cortical overcompensation may contribute to the ability to perceive transition duration contrasts. Cortical overcompensation appears to be a maladaptive response to decreased neural firing/synchrony.\nPMID:\n38781768\n| PMC:\nPMC11156531\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109034",

Epub 2024 May 16.\nABSTRACT\nCochlear implants are medical devices that have restored hearing to approximately one million people around the world. Outcomes are impressive and most recipients attain excellent speech comprehension in quiet without relying on lip-reading cues, but pitch resolution is poor compared to normal hearing. Amplitude modulation of electrical stimulation is a primary cue for pitch perception in cochlear implant users. The experiments described in this article focus on the relationship between sensitivity to amplitude modulations and pitch resolution based on changes in the frequency of amplitude modulations. In the first experiment, modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution were measured in adults with no known hearing loss and in cochlear implant users with sounds presented to and processed by their clinical devices. Stimuli were amplitude-modulated sinusoids and amplitude-modulated narrow-band noises. Modulation detection and modulation frequency discrimination were measured for modulation frequencies centered on 110, 220, and 440 Hz. Pitch resolution based on changes in modulation frequency was measured for modulation depths of 25 %, 50 %, 100 %, and for a half-waved rectified modulator. Results revealed a strong linear relationship between modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution for cochlear implant users and peers with no known hearing loss. In the second experiment, cochlear implant users took part in analogous procedures of modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution but bypassing clinical sound processing using single-electrode stimulation. Results indicated that modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution was better conveyed by single-electrode stimulation than by clinical processors. Results at 440 Hz were worse, but also not well conveyed by clinical sound processing, so it remains unclear whether the 300 Hz perceptual limit described in the literature is a technological or biological limitation. These results highlight modulation depth and sensitivity as critical factors for pitch resolution in cochlear implant users and characterize the relationship that should inform the design of modulation enhancement algorithms for cochlear implants.\nPMID:\n38776706\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109026",

Epub 2024 May 14.\nABSTRACT\nSex is a pivotal biological factor that significantly impacts tissue homeostasis and disease susceptibility. In the auditory system, sex differences have been observed in cochlear physiology and responses to pathological conditions. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences remain elusive. The current research explores the differences in gene expression profiles in the cochlea between male and female mice, aiming to understand the functional implication of sex-biased gene expression in each sex. Using RNA-sequencing analysis on cochlear tissues obtained from male and female mice, we identified a significant number of genes exhibiting sex-biased expression differences. While some of these differentially expressed genes are located on sex chromosomes, most are found on autosomal chromosomes. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that these genes are involved in several key cellular functions. In males, these genes are notably linked to oxidative phosphorylation and RNA synthesis and processing, suggesting their involvement in mitochondrial energy production and regulatory control of gene expression. In contrast, sex-biased genes are associated with mechano-transduction and synaptic transmission within female cochleae. Collectively, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular differences between the sexes and emphasizes the need for future research to uncover their functional implications and relevance to auditory health and disease development.\nPMID:\n38776705\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109030",

Statistical and thematic analyses were used to examine the rating scale and open response elements of the questionnaires respectively.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 45 families participated, 24 randomised to MHEfC and 21 to standard care.\nRESULTS: Use of MHEfC increased the appointment duration by 8.2 minutes (95% CI 4.1 to 14.2 minutes), which was acceptable to parents (96%) and audiologists (67%). It promoted conversation around 'behavioural and communication tactics', 'specific listening situations' and 'listening effort' at the expense of 'anatomy/physiology/aetiology'. MHEfC positively impacted the discussion of test results (54%); ease of finding joint solutions to problems (71%); and the nature of issues and management options discussed (54%).

Existing interventions lack effectiveness and are typically not based on a theoretically driven, comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing infant hearing aid use. The present study is the first to address this gap in understanding.\nDESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: A 55-item online survey based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was completed by 56 parents of 0-3-year-old hearing aid users.\nRESULTS: Participants reported a wide range of barriers across TDF domains, which were associated with parent-reported hearing aid use and more pronounced in parents of lower hearing aid users. The most strongly reported domains across participants were \"emotion\" (e.g. feelings of worry when using hearing aids), \"beliefs about capabilities\" (e.g. belief in ability to use hearing aids consistently), and \"environmental context and resources\" (e.g. child removing hearing aids).\nCONCLUSIONS: Parents report a wider range of barriers to infant hearing aid use than existing investigations suggest and current interventions address.

The average DR across frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) was correlated with the patients' assigned word recognition score (WRS) in quiet.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: A data set of 66 cases (4 bilateral and 2 revised cases) from 60 implanted patients between 14.3-81.8 years were analysed.\nRESULTS: The relationship between DR and WRS was described by a sigmoidal growth function with R\n2\n=0.6371 and a maximum WRS (upper asymptote) of 93.5%. Word recognition scores in quiet improved with increasing DR. A significant shift in performance was detected from DR bin 2 (10-20 dB, median WRS 55%) to bin 3 (20-30 dB, median WRS 80%) and from DR bin 4 (30-40 dB, median WRS 82.5%) to bin 5 (40-50 dB, median WRS 90%).\nCONCLUSION: A minimum DR of 20 dB can yield sufficient speech intelligibility in quiet in implanted patients, however, an optimum DR is suggested to be 40 dB.\nPMID:\n38832702\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2360031",

Outcomes of interest were audiologists' language complexity, use of jargon, and audiologist-patient interactivity. Semi-structured patient interviews, conducted 1-7 days after appointments, were analysed using inductive qualitative content analysis. Patient recall was verified.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Four audiologists from one United Kingdom audiology service, and 22 patients (mean age 63.5 yrs) participated.\nRESULTS: In comparison to standard audiogram explanations, audiologists' language was simpler and audiologist-patient interactivity greater with the MHE tool.

Two themes were identified, specifically: (1) an association between HL and hearing aids and the stereotypes of ageing, disability, and difference; and (2) varied views on the existence and experience of stigma for adults with HL. Hearing care professionals focused on the stigma of hearing aids more than HL, whereas adult participants focused on stigma of HL. Family member data indicated that they experienced little affiliate stigma.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stigma-induced identity threat related to HL and, to a lesser extent, hearing aids exists for adults with HL.

Relations between attenuation measured on participants (for 6 different earplugs) and their earcanal size assessed with the EE are established via comparison tests.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 121 participants exposed to occupational noise (103 men, 18 women, mean age 47 year\ns\n).\nRESULTS: The earcanal size assessed with the EE allows for estimating the area of the earcanal's first bend cross-section (correlation coefficient  r = 0.533,\np\n< 0.001). Extremely large earcanals (12.7% of earcanals in our sample) lead to significantly lower earplug attenuation (potentially inadequate) than smaller earcanals.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EE is a simple and inexpensive tool easily deployable in the field to assist earplugs selection.

To also investigate the effects of three otologic history factors.\nDESIGN: Using headphone presentation, speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured with simple sentences. As maskers, stationary speech-shaped noise (SSN) or two-talker running speech (TTS) were used. The stimuli were presented in a monaural and binaural condition (SSN) or a co-located and spatially separated condition (TTS). Based on the available medical records, overall OM duration, OM onset age, and time since the last OM episode were estimated.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 6-13-year-olds with a history of recurrent OM (\nN\n= 42) or without any ear diseases (\nN\n= 20) with normal tympanograms and audiograms at the time of testing.\nRESULTS: Mixed-model regression analyses that controlled for age showed poorer SRTs for the OM group (Δ-value = 0.84 dB,\np\n= 0.009). These appeared driven by the spatially separated, binaural, and monaural conditions. The OM group showed large inter-individual differences, which were unrelated to the otologic history factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early-childhood OM can affect speech recognition in different acoustic conditions. The effects of the otologic history warrant further investigation.\nPMID:\n38767554\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2348506",

Participants with hearing loss underwent testing in two device conditions: hearing aids (HAs) alone and HAs with a RM. Normal hearing participants completed testing in the unaided condition. Predictive speech intelligibility modelling using the Hearing-Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) was also performed on recordings of HA processed test material.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Twenty adults with sensory hearing loss and 10 adults with normal hearing participated.\nRESULTS: Speech recognition for participants with hearing loss improved significantly when using the RM compared to HAs alone fit to Phonak's proprietary prescription. Largest benefits were observed in the most challenging conditions. At the lowest signal-to-noise ratio, participants with hearing loss using a RM outperformed normal hearing listeners. Predicted intelligibility scores produced by HASPI were strongly correlated to behavioural results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adults using HAs who have significant difficulties understanding speech in noise will experience considerable benefits with the addition of a RM. Improvements in speech recognition were observed for all participants using RM systems, including those with relatively mild hearing loss.

The data were analysed in line with the constant comparative approach of grounded theory. A substantial patient and public engagement (PPIE) strategy underpinned decisions and processes throughout.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Adults were recruited from age bands (16-29; 30-49;50-79 and 80 upwards) to provide different lived experience.

This project examined adults' recollections of discussions with their audiologist to explore (1) how adults report describing their listening difficulties and (2) information that adults report they do not communicate, or do not communicate successfully, to their audiologist.\nDESIGN: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interview transcripts were analysed using a template analysis approach.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen adults who self-report listening difficulties, and who had previously consulted an audiologist.\nRESULTS: Four themes were identified from adults' recollections of how they describe their listening difficulties: (1) situation or context of listening difficulties, (2) behavioural responses, (3) impacts of listening difficulties and (4) contributing factors. Adults report not always successfully communicating (1) emotional concerns and impacts, (2) descriptions of sound quality and (3) descriptions of changed listening experiences.\nCONCLUSION: Results provide insights about the times when adults feel that communication with their audiologist is successful, or unsuccessful. The results are useful for informing interventions to help adults and audiologists communicate more effectively together.

Late peaks were present bilaterally in 78%. The p13-n23 response was present in all patients with SNHL but normal vestibular function, and 43% had late waves. Statistical comparison of these patients to a subset of age-matched controls showed no significant difference in the frequencies, amplitudes or latencies of their ipsilateral early and late peaks. cVEMPs were absent in all patients with vestibular impairment.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of long-latency cVEMP waves was not dependent on the integrity of sensorineural hearing pathways, but instead correlated with intact vestibular function. This finding conflicts with the view that these late waves are cochlear in origin, and suggests that vestibular afferents may assume a more prominent role in their generation.\nPMID:\n38739080\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2341101",

Standard hearing aids differ from a CI in terms of processing strategy and function as a separate entity, requiring the user to integrate the disparate signals. Integrated bimodal technology has recently been introduced to address this challenge. The aim of the study was to investigate the performance of unilateral CI users with and without an integrated bimodal fitting and determine whether binaural streaming technology offers additional benefit.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-six CI users using integrated bimodal technology.\nDESIGN: Repeated measures where outcomes and user experience were assessed using a functional test battery more representative of real life listening (speech perception in noise tests, localisation test, tracking test) and the speech, spatial and qualities-of-hearing scale (SSQ).\nRESULTS: Bimodal outcomes were significantly better than for CI alone. Speech perception in noise improvements ranged from 1.4 dB to 3.5 dB depending on the location of speech and noise. The localisation and tracking tests, and the SSQ also showed significant improvements. Binaural streaming offered additional improvement (1.2 dB to 6.1 dB on the different speech tests).\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrated bimodal and binaural streaming technology improved the performance of unilateral CI users.\nPMID:\n38701176\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2341954",

The intended impact was to support practice regarding candidacy assessment and prognostic counseling of pediatric cochlear implant candidates. Data in the clinical chart of children implanted at 9-11 months of age with Cochlear Ltd devices at five cochlear implant centers in the United States and Canada were included in analyses. The study included data from two cohorts implanted with one or two Nucleus devices during the periods of January 1, 2012-December 31, 2017 (Cohort 1, n = 83) or between January 1, 2018 and May 15, 2020 (Cohort 2, n = 50). Major adverse events (requiring another procedure/hospitalization) and minor adverse events (managed with medication alone or underwent an expected course of treatment that did not require surgery or hospitalization) out to 2 years post-implant were monitored and outcomes measured by audiometric thresholds and parent-reports on the IT-MAIS and LittlEARS questionnaires were collected. Results revealed 60 adverse events in 41 children and 227 ears implanted (26%) of which 14 major events occurred in 11 children; all were transitory and resolved. Improved hearing with cochlear implant use was shown in all outcome measures. Findings reveal that the procedure is safe for infants and that they show clear benefits of cochlear implantation including increased audibility and hearing development.\nPMID:\n38887094\n| PMC:\nPMC11185016\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241261480",

For almost as many years, clinicians and researchers have sought ways to distill the volume and complexity of information on the audiogram. Commonly used approaches have made use of pure-tone averages (PTAs) for various frequency ranges with the PTA for 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (PTA4) being the most widely used for the categorization of hearing loss severity. Here, a three-digit triad is proposed as a single-number summary of not only the severity, but also the configuration and bilateral symmetry of the hearing loss. Each digit in the triad ranges from 0 to 9, increasing as the level of the pure-tone hearing threshold level (HTL) increases from a range of optimal hearing (< 10 dB Hearing Level; HL) to complete hearing loss (≥ 90 dB HL). Each digit also represents a different frequency region of the audiogram proceeding from left to right as: (Low, L) PTA for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz; (Center, C) PTA for 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz; and (High, H) HTL at 8000 Hz. This LCH Triad audiogram-classification system is evaluated using a large United States (U.S.) national dataset (N = 8,795) from adults 20 to 80 + years of age and two large clinical datasets totaling 8,254 adults covering a similar age range. Its ability to capture variations in hearing function was found to be superior to that of the widely used PTA4.\nPMID:\n38870447\n| PMC:\nPMC11179497\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260041",

However, its validity has been a subject of debate, as previous studies noted differences between hearing thresholds measured using conventional and in-situ audiometry. The differences were particularly notable for open-fit hearing aids, attributed to low-frequency leakage caused by the vent. Here, in-situ audiometry was investigated for six receiver-in-canal hearing aids from different manufacturers through three experiments. In Experiment I, the hearing aid gain was measured to investigate whether corrections were implemented to the prescribed target gain. In Experiment II, the in-situ stimuli were recorded to investigate if corrections were directly incorporated to the delivered in-situ stimulus. Finally, in Experiment III, hearing thresholds using in-situ and conventional audiometry were measured with real patients wearing open-fit hearing aids. Results indicated that (1) the hearing aid gain remained unaffected when measured with in-situ or conventional audiometry for all open-fit measurements, (2) the in-situ stimuli were adjusted for up to 30 dB at frequencies below 1000 Hz for all open-fit hearing aids except one, which also recommends the use of closed domes for all in-situ measurements, and (3) the mean interparticipant threshold difference fell within 5 dB for frequencies between 250 and 6000 Hz. The results clearly indicated that modern measured in-situ thresholds align (within 5 dB) with conventional thresholds measured, indicating the potential of in-situ audiometry for remote hearing care.\nPMID:\n38835268\n| PMC:\nPMC11155351\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241259704",

One possible source of benefit is ANC's ability to reduce the sound level of the direct (i.e., vent-transmitted) path. This reduction lowers the \"floor\" imposed by the direct path, thereby allowing any increases to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) created in the amplified path to be \"realized\" at the eardrum. Here we used a modeling approach to estimate this benefit. We compared pairs of simulated hearing aids that differ only in terms of their ability to provide ANC and computed intelligibility metrics on their outputs. The difference in metric scores between simulated devices is termed the \"ANC Benefit.\" These simulations show that ANC Benefit increases as (1) the environmental sound level increases, (2) the ability of the hearing aid to improve SNR increases, (3) the strength of the ANC increases, and (4) the hearing loss severity decreases. The predicted size of the ANC Benefit can be substantial. For a moderate hearing loss, the model predicts improvement in intelligibility metrics of >30% when environments are moderately loud (>70 dB SPL) and devices are moderately capable of increasing SNR (by >4 dB). It appears that ANC can be a critical ingredient in hearing devices that attempt to improve SNR in loud environments. ANC will become more and more important as advanced SNR-improving algorithms (e.g., artificial intelligence speech enhancement) are included in hearing devices.\nPMID:\n38831646\n| PMC:\nPMC11149449\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260029",

The data were retrieved from a total of 52 children with MBHL and 30 children with normal hearing (NH). The association between demographical, audiological factors and language outcomes was examined. Analyses of variance were conducted to compare the language abilities of HA users, non-HA users, and their NH peers. Furthermore, regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of language outcomes. Aided better ear pure-tone average (BEPTA) was significantly correlated with language comprehension scores. Among children with MBHL, those who used HA outperformed the ones who did not use HA across all linguistic domains. The language skills of children with MBHL were comparable to those of their peers with NH. The degree of improvement in audibility in terms of aided BEPTA was a significant predictor of language comprehension. It is noteworthy that 50% of the parents expressed reluctance regarding HA use for their children with MBHL. The findings highlight the positive impact of HA usage on language development in this population. Professionals may therefore consider HAs as a viable treatment option for children with MBHL, especially when there is a potential risk of language delay due to hearing loss. It was observed that 25% of the children with MBHL had late-onset hearing loss. Consequently, the implementation of preschool screening or a listening performance checklist is recommended to facilitate early detection.\nPMID:\n38773778\n| PMC:\nPMC11113073\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241256721",

Progressing beyond these unnatural stimuli, brainstem responses to continuous speech presented via earphones have been recently detected using linear temporal response functions (TRFs). Here, we extend earlier studies by measuring subcortical responses to continuous speech presented in the sound-field, and assess the amount of data needed to estimate brainstem TRFs. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 24 normal hearing participants while they listened to clicks and stories presented via earphones and loudspeakers. Subcortical TRFs were computed after accounting for non-linear processing in the auditory periphery by either stimulus rectification or an auditory nerve model. Our results demonstrated that subcortical responses to continuous speech could be reliably measured in the sound-field. TRFs estimated using auditory nerve models outperformed simple rectification, and 16 minutes of data was sufficient for the TRFs of all participants to show clear wave V peaks for both earphones and sound-field stimuli. Subcortical TRFs to continuous speech were highly consistent in both earphone and sound-field conditions, and with click ABRs. However, sound-field TRFs required slightly more data (16 minutes) to achieve clear wave V peaks compared to earphone TRFs (12 minutes), possibly due to effects of room acoustics. By investigating subcortical responses to sound-field speech stimuli, this study lays the groundwork for bringing objective hearing assessment closer to real-life conditions, which may lead to improved hearing evaluations and smart hearing technologies.\nPMID:\n38738341\n| PMC:\nPMC11092544\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246596",

Both age and noise exposure contribute to synaptopathy in animal models, indicating that it may be a common type of auditory dysfunction in humans. Temporal bone and auditory physiological data suggest that age and occupational/military noise exposure also lead to synaptopathy in humans. The predicted perceptual consequences of synaptopathy include tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. However, confirming the perceptual impacts of this form of cochlear deafferentation presents a particular challenge because synaptopathy can only be confirmed through post-mortem temporal bone analysis and auditory perception is difficult to evaluate in animals. Animal data suggest that deafferentation leads to increased central gain, signs of tinnitus and abnormal loudness perception, and deficits in temporal processing and signal-in-noise detection. If equivalent changes occur in humans following deafferentation, this would be expected to increase the likelihood of developing tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. Physiological data from humans is consistent with the hypothesis that deafferentation is associated with increased central gain and a greater likelihood of tinnitus perception, while human data on the relationship between deafferentation and hyperacusis is extremely limited. Many human studies have investigated the relationship between physiological correlates of deafferentation and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception, with mixed findings. A non-linear relationship between deafferentation and speech perception may have contributed to the mixed results. When differences in sample characteristics and study measurements are considered, the findings may be more consistent.\nPMID:\n38738337\n| PMC:\nPMC11092548\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241239541",

A total of 4,589 SM undergoing annual audiometric surveillance were prospectively recruited to complete the THS tinnitus subscale (THS-T). A subset of 1,304 participants also completed the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). The original 5-point response scale of the THS (THS-T\n16\n) was modified to an 11-point scale (THS-T\n40\n) for some participants, to align with the response scale of the TFI. Age, sex, hearing loss, and self-reported tinnitus bother were also recorded. The THS-T was relatively insensitive to hearing, but self-reported bothersome tinnitus was significantly associated with the THS-T\n40\nscore. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine cutoff scores on the THS-T that aligned with recommended cutoff values for clinical intervention on the TFI. A cutoff of 9 on the THS-T\n40\naligns with a TFI cutoff of 25, indicating a patient may need intervention for tinnitus. A cutoff of 15 aligns with a TFI cutoff of 50, indicating that more aggressive intervention for tinnitus is warranted. The THS-T is a viable tool to identify patients with tinnitus complaints warranting clinical evaluation for use by hearing conservation programs and primary care clinics. The THS-T\n40\ncutoff scores of 9 and 15 provide clinical reference points to guide referrals to audiology.\nPMID:\n38738302\n| PMC:\nPMC11092559\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241242235",

A promising method is electrocochleography (ECochG). Within this project the relations between intracochlear ECochG recordings, position of the recording contact in the cochlea with respect to anatomy and frequency and preservation of residual hearing were investigated. The aim was to better understand the changes in ECochG signals and whether these are due to the electrode position in the cochlea or to trauma generated during insertion. During and after insertion of hearing preservation electrodes, intraoperative ECochG recordings were performed using the CI electrode (MED-EL). During insertion, the recordings were performed at discrete insertion steps on electrode contact 1. After insertion as well as postoperatively the recordings were performed at different electrode contacts. The electrode location in the cochlea during insertion was estimated by mathematical models using preoperative clinical imaging, the postoperative location was measured using postoperative clinical imaging. The recordings were analyzed from six adult CI recipients. In the four patients with good residual hearing in the low frequencies the signal amplitude rose with largest amplitudes being recorded closest to the generators of the stimulation frequency, while in both cases with severe pantonal hearing losses the amplitude initially rose and then dropped. This might be due to various reasons as discussed in the following. Our results indicate that this approach can provide valuable information for the interpretation of intracochlearly recorded ECochG signals.\nPMID:\n38717441\n| PMC:\nPMC11080744\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241248973",

A link with the degree of postoperative hearing preservation in patients was investigated, but patient populations were usually small. Therefore, this study's aim was to analyze data from intraoperative extracochlear electrocochleography (ECochG) recordings for a larger group.During hearing preservation CI surgery, extracochlear recordings were made before, during, and after CI electrode insertion using a cotton wick electrode placed at the promontory. Before and after insertion, amplitudes and stimulus response thresholds were recorded at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz. During insertion, response amplitudes were recorded at one frequency and one stimulus level. Data from 121 patient ears were analyzed.The key benefit of extracochlear recordings is that they can be performed before, during, and after CI electrode insertion. However, extracochlear ECochG threshold changes before and after CI insertion were relatively small and did not independently correlate well with hearing preservation, although at 250 Hz they added some significant information. Some tendencies-although no significant relationships-were detected between amplitude behavior and hearing preservation. Rising amplitudes seem favorable and falling amplitudes disadvantageous, but constant amplitudes do not appear to allow stringent predictions.Extracochlear ECochG measurements seem to only partially realize expected benefits. The questions now are: do gains justify the effort, and do other procedures or possible combinations lead to greater benefits for patients?\nPMID:\n38715410\n| PMC:\nPMC11080760\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241252240",

Literature suggests that listening effort measures may be more sensitive to differences between hearing-device settings than established speech intelligibility measures when speech intelligibility is near maximum. Which method provides the most effective measurement of listening effort for this purpose is currently unclear. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of two tests for measuring changes in listening effort in CI users due to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) differences, as would arise from different hearing-device settings. By comparing the effect size of SNR differences on listening effort measures with test-retest differences, the study evaluated the suitability of these tests for clinical use. Nineteen CI users underwent two listening effort tests at two SNRs (+4 and +8 dB relative to individuals' 50% speech perception threshold). We employed dual-task paradigms-a sentence-final word identification and recall test (SWIRT) and a sentence verification test (SVT)-to assess listening effort at these two SNRs. Our results show a significant difference in listening effort between the SNRs for both test methods, although the effect size was comparable to the test-retest difference, and the sensitivity was not superior to speech intelligibility measures. Thus, the implementations of SVT and SWIRT used in this study are not suitable for clinical use to measure listening effort differences of this magnitude in individual CI users. However, they can be used in research involving CI users to analyze group data.\nPMID:\n38676325\n| PMC:\nPMC11055488\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241240572",

For hearing care, this means that hearing aid benefits can potentially be overshadowed by adverse experiences. Research has shown that sustaining focus on positive experiences has the potential to mitigate negativity bias. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether a positive focus (PF) intervention can improve speech-in-noise abilities for experienced hearing aid users. Thirty participants were randomly allocated to a control or PF group (N = 2 × 15). Prior to hearing aid fitting, all participants filled out the short form of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale (SSQ12) based on their own hearing aids. At the first visit, they were fitted with study hearing aids, and speech-in-noise testing was performed. Both groups then wore the study hearing aids for two weeks and sent daily text messages reporting hours of hearing aid use to an experimenter. In addition, the PF group was instructed to focus on positive listening experiences and to also report them in the daily text messages. After the 2-week trial, all participants filled out the SSQ12 questionnaire based on the study hearing aids and completed the speech-in-noise testing again. Speech-in-noise performance and SSQ12 Qualities score were improved for the PF group but not for the control group. This finding indicates that the PF intervention can improve subjective and objective hearing aid benefits.\nPMID:\n38656770\n| PMC:\nPMC11044800\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246616",

However, wearing hearing devices can also have negative effects on perception, previously demonstrated mostly for spatial hearing, sound quality and the perception of the own voice. When hearing devices are set to transparency, that is, provide no gain and resemble open-ear listening as well as possible, these side effects can be studied in isolation. In the present work, we conducted a series of experiments that are concerned with the effect of transparent hearing devices on speech perception in a collocated speech-in-noise task. In such a situation, listening through a hearing device is not expected to have any negative effect, since both speech and noise undergo identical processing, such that the signal-to-noise ratio at ear is not altered and spatial effects are irrelevant. However, we found a consistent hearing device disadvantage for speech intelligibility and similar trends for rated listening effort. Several hypotheses for the possible origin for this disadvantage were tested by including several different devices, gain settings and stimulus levels. While effects of self-noise and nonlinear distortions were ruled out, the exact reason for a hearing device disadvantage on speech perception is still unclear. However, a significant relation to auditory model predictions demonstrate that the speech intelligibility disadvantage is related to sound quality, and is most probably caused by insufficient equalization, artifacts of frequency-dependent signal processing and processing delays.\nPMID:\n38629486\n| PMC:\nPMC11025430\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246597",

With current technology, most CI users obtain very good speech understanding in quiet listening environments. However, many CI users still struggle when listening to music. Efforts have been made to preprocess music for CI users and improve their music enjoyment. This work investigates potential modifications of instrumental music to make it more accessible for CI users. For this purpose, we used two datasets with varying complexity and containing individual tracks of instrumental music. The first dataset contained trios and it was newly created and synthesized for this study. The second dataset contained orchestral music with a large number of instruments. Bilateral CI users and normal hearing listeners were asked to remix the multitracks grouped into melody, bass, accompaniment, and percussion. Remixes could be performed in the amplitude, spatial, and spectral domains. Results showed that CI users preferred tracks being panned toward the right side, especially the percussion component. When CI users were grouped into frequent or occasional music listeners, significant differences in remixing preferences in all domains were observed.\nPMID:\n38613359\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241245219",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Localization of a sound source in the horizontal plane depends on the listener's interaural comparison of arrival time and level. Hearing loss (HL) can reduce access to these binaural cues, possibly disrupting the localization and memory of spatial information. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the horizontal sound localization performance and the spatial short-term memory in listeners with actual and simulated HL.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Seventeen listeners with bilateral symmetric HL and 17 listeners with normal hearing (NH) participated in the study. The hearing thresholds of NH listeners were elevated by a spectrally shaped masking noise for the simulations of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) and bilateral hearing loss (BHL). The localization accuracy and errors as well as the spatial short-term memory span were measured in the free field using a set of 11 loudspeakers arrayed over a 150° arc.\nRESULTS: : The localization abilities and spatial short-term memory span did not significantly differ between actual BHL listeners and BHL-simulated NH listeners. Overall, the localization performance with the UHL simulation was approximately twofold worse than that with the BHL simulation, and the hearing asymmetry led to a detrimental effect on spatial memory. The mean localization score as a function of stimulus location in the UHL simulation was less than 30% even for the front (0° azimuth) stimuli and much worse on the side closer to the simulated ear. In the UHL simulation, the localization responses were biased toward the side of the intact ear even when sounds were coming from the front.\nCONCLUSIONS: : Hearing asymmetry induced by the UHL simulation substantially disrupted the localization performance and recall abilities of spatial positions encoded and stored in the memory, due to fewer chances to learn strategies to improve localization. The marked effect of hearing asymmetry on sound localization highlights the need for clinical assessments of spatial hearing in addition to conventional hearing tests.\nPMID:\n38946331\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00206",

Patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUVP) show a systematic SVV bias toward the affected side, whichever the side of line orientation. Whether SVV estimates are symmetrical has not been investigated.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : This study included 10 patients with AUVP (vestibular neuritis) and 10 with BPPV (posterior semicircular canal). SVV measurements were made at two preset angles of line orientation (15° and 30°) toward the ipsilateral and contralateral sides, relative to the affected side.\nRESULTS: : The results showed asymmetrical SVV estimates in the AUVP group, with significantly greater SVV errors for ipsilateral than contralateral line orientation, as well as for the preset angle of 30° compared to 15°. SVV estimates were significantly lower in patients with BPPV who also exhibited SVV asymmetry. SVV estimates remained unchanged just after the maneuver and were normalized some days later or after supplementary maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: : SVV asymmetry should be routinely considered in the clinic. We recommend individually assessing ipsilateral and contralateral SVV and using at least two preset angles. This allows for a better assessment and diagnosis of otolith organ imbalance that can trigger chronic instability and dizziness. The contribution of neck afferents related to head position in space seems to be the main source of SVV asymmetry.\nPMID:\n38946330\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00346",

Subjects and.\nMETHODS: This study included 24 patients with diagnosed developmental delays and syndromes, who demonstrated SQ scores of <70. Preoperative social skills were evaluated using the SQ. All patients underwent cochlear implantation (CI) surgery before 7 years of age. Outcomes were evaluated using the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) and Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) scores. Data were collected through a retrospective chart review.\nRESULTS: Children were categorized into three groups based on their SQ. There were no correlations between the preoperative SQ and IT-MAIS or CAP scores at 2 and 5 years of follow-up postoperatively. The CI outcomes of children with low SQ (<70) differed from those with normal development (SQ>70). In the low-SQ group, inner ear anomalies were observed in 10 (41.7%) patients. Although not statistically significant, these children exhibited a trend of lower average outcomes than children without inner ear anomalies.\nCONCLUSIONS: CI outcomes in children with additional needs positively affected auditory performance. Postoperative auditory and language skills tended to improve slowly in children with additional needs and a lower SQ. Over time, development gradually became more comparable to the other groups of children. However, this improvement was less than that observed in children without additional needs.

Twenty-eight recently published intracochlear ECoG articles were thoroughly reviewed to investigate the prognostic utility of intraoperative ECoG monitoring to assess hearing preservation, and the clinical applicability of postoperative ECoG for estimating audiometric thresholds and monitoring longitudinal changes in residual acoustic hearing in patients with EAS. Intraoperative ECoG studies have focused on monitoring the changes in the cochlear microphonics (CM) amplitudes during and after electrode insertion. Mixed results have been reported regarding the relationship between changes in CM amplitude in the operating room and changes in hearing thresholds after surgery. Postoperative ECoG studies have shown that CM and auditory nerve neurophonics thresholds correlate significantly with behavioral thresholds. ECoG thresholds sensitively detect changes as residual acoustic hearing decreases over time in some CI users. This indicates its potential clinical value for monitoring the post-implantation status of the peripheral auditory system. Intracochlear ECoG can provide real-time intraoperative feedback and monitor postoperative hearing preservation in a growing population of CI users.\nPMID:\n38695055\n| PMC:\nPMC11065546\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00129",

Nonetheless, the conventional application of panel and exome sequencing in real-world practice is being challenged by the emerging need to explore the diagnostic capability of whole-genome sequencing, which enables the detection of both noncoding and structural variations. Small molecules and gene therapies represent good examples of how breakthroughs in genetic understanding can be translated into targeted therapies for SNHL. For example, targeted small molecules have been used to ameliorate autoinflammatory hearing loss caused by gain-of-function variants of NLRP3 and inner ear proteinopathy with OSBPL2 variants underlying dysfunctional autophagy. Strikingly, the successful outcomes of the first-in-human trial of OTOF gene therapy highlighted its potential in the treatment of various forms of genetic hearing loss. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies are currently being developed for site-specific genome editing to treat human genetic disorders. These advancements have led to an era of genotype- and mechanism-based precision medicine in SNHL practice.\nPMID:\n38695053\n| PMC:\nPMC11065549\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00157",

When evaluating young children for cochlear implantation, there are unique considerations beyond the standard issues addressed during surgery in adults. Because of advances in genetic testing, imaging resolution, CI technology, post-implant rehabilitation, and other factors, issues related to CI surgery in children continue to evolve. Such factors have led to changes in candidacy guidelines, vaccine requirements, and lowering of age requirement for surgery. In addition, differences in the anatomy and physiology of infants require special attention to ensure safety when operating on young children. This review summarizes these issues and provides guidance for surgeons treating children with SNHL.\nPMID:\n38695052\n| PMC:\nPMC11065545\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00073",

The meter, representing a well-organized sequence of evenly spaced beats in music, exhibits a hierarchical arrangement, with stronger beats occupying higher metrical positions. Moreover, the meter has been shown to influence behavioral and neural processing, particularly the N1, P2, and mismatch negativity components. However, the role of the P1 component in the context of metrical hierarchy remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component and compare the responses between musicians and non-musicians.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Thirty participants (15 musicians and 15 non-musicians) were enrolled in the study. Auditory stimuli consisted of a synthesized speech syllable presented together with a repeating series of four tones, establishing a quadruple meter. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to measure the P1 component.\nRESULTS: : The results revealed that metrical position had a significant effect on P1 amplitude, with the strongest beat showing the lowest amplitude. This contrasts with previous findings, in which enhanced P1 responses were typically observed at on-the-beat positions. The reduced P1 response on the strong beat can be interpreted within the framework of predictive coding and temporal prediction, where a higher predictability of pitch changes at the strong beat leads to a reduction in the P1 response. Furthermore, higher P1 amplitudes were observed in musicians compared to non-musicians, suggesting that musicians have enhanced sensory processing.\nCONCLUSIONS: : This study demonstrates the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component, thereby enriching our understanding of auditory processing. The results suggest that predictive coding and temporal prediction play important roles in shaping sensory processing. Further, they suggest that musical training may enhance P1 responses.\nPMID:\n38685834\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00262",

The present study examined cognitive function in CI users by employing a web-based cognitive testing platform, i.e., BrainCheck, and explored the correlation between cognitive function and subjective evaluation of hearing.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Forty-two CI users (mean age: 58.90 years) were surveyed in the subjective evaluation of hearing, and 20/42 participated in the BrainCheck cognitive tests (immediate recognition, Trail Making A, Trail Making B, Stroop, digit symbol substitution, and delayed recognition). As controls for cognitive function, young normal-hearing (YNH, mean age=23.83 years) and older normal-hearing (ONH, mean age=52.67 years) listener groups were subjected to Brain- Check testing.\nRESULTS: : CI users exhibited poorer cognitive function than the normal hearing groups in all tasks except for immediate and delayed recognition. The highest percentage of CI users who had \"possible\" and \"likely\" cognitive impairment, based on BrainCheck scores (ranging from 0-200), was observed in tests assessing executive function. The composite cognitive score across domains tended to be related to subjective hearing (p=0.07).\nCONCLUSIONS: : The findings of the current study suggest that CI users had a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment in the executive function domain than in lower-level domains.

Among the side effects of these drugs, alterations associated with the auditory system are frequently mentioned. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to systematically review publications on hearing disorders and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were observational or interventional studies on audiological assessment in participants who were using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Meta-Analysis of Statistics: assessment and review Instrument. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,372 non-duplicate papers were screened, out of which 17 were included in the final qualitative synthesis, and 5 studies in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio for the two subgroups evaluated did not show significance with no heterogeneity between the effects observed between the different diseases (I2=0%) and obtaining the global estimate of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.41-1.39; p>0.05). Despite the inclusion of papers with different disease samples, the heterogeneity observed in the analysis was low (I2= 0%) and prediction interval (95% PI=0.32-1.80; p>0.05) remained close to that estimated by the CI (95% CI=0.41-1.39; p>0.05). The certainty of the evidence assessed by the GRADE tool was considered very low due to the risk of bias, indirect evidence, and imprecision.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is not associated with hearing disorders.\nPMID:\n38382520\n| PMC:\nPMC11065553\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00157",

Since OAE measurements do not require active participation of a listener, OAEs are considered an objective measure of cochlear function. While distortion-product OAEs (DPOAEs) are commonly used in clinical practice, limited information is available on the performance of various clinical devices. This study compared two commercial clinical devices, Titan and Eclipse from Interacoustics, and collected normative data for DPOAEs in people with normal hearing. The data collection and analysis were focused on signal and noise amplitudes as well as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three participants with normal hearing (age 23.2±2.0 years) were included in the study. DPOAEs were measured at 31 frequencies ranging from 500 to 10,000 Hz.\nRESULTS: DPOAE amplitude differed across frequencies. Additionally, a high number of unreliable responses were observed at the edge frequencies (<828 Hz and >6,072 Hz). There were no significant differences between the two devices in terms of DPOAE amplitudes, but the recorded-noise levels (amplitude) differed significantly. SNRs of the recorded OAEs were frequency dependent (higher frequencies showed larger SNRs), and significant differences in terms of SNR were found between the two devices.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the above-mentioned differences, the OAEs recorded with both devices met the pass criteria for the SNR (≥6 dB) consistently across frequencies, and thus the differences do not compromise the test outcomes. The frequency dependence of the OAE amplitudes and the corresponding SNRs may be relevant for clinical practice.\nPMID:\n38382519\n| PMC:\nPMC11065547\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00269",

Although etiologic factors, including viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and vascular issues, contribute to the understanding of SSNHL, the condition remains unclear in most cases. Systemic steroids are often used as the first-line treatment because they reduce inner ear inflammation; however, there remains numerous discussions about the effectiveness of alternative treatments. To predict hearing recovery is crucial in patients' counseling with factors, including delayed treatment, vertigo, and other health conditions, which indicate poor prognosis. Herein, we review contemporary research on the treatment approaches and outcome predictions of SSNHL to establish important guidelines for physicians in evaluating and treating patients with SSNHL.\nPMID:\n38254304\n| PMC:\nPMC10808390\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00024",

This study aimed to identify changing trends in distributions of hearing threshold levels across ages by comparing the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7029 and newly available data after publishing ISO 7029. To compare ISO 7029 and newly available hearing threshold data after publishing ISO 7029, four country-specific datasets that presented average hearing threshold levels under conditions similar to ISO 7029 were utilized. For frequencies between 125 Hz and 8,000 Hz, the deviations of hearing threshold values by ages from the hearing threshold of the youngest age group for each data point were utilized. For frequencies from 9,000 Hz to 12,500 Hz, the median threshold information was utilized. Hearing threshold data reported after publishing ISO 7029 from the four countries were mostly similar to the ISO 7029 data but tended to deviate in some age groups and sexes. As national hearing threshold trends change, the following ISO 7029 revision suggests the need to integrate hearing threshold data from different countries.\nPMID:\n38254303\n| PMC:\nPMC10808389\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00626",

This study aimed to address a research gap by investigating sources and levels of occupational stress in U.K. audiologists.\nMETHOD: A mixed-methods cross-sectional design and convenience sampling were utilized. The study used the Audiologist Occupational Stress Questionnaire (AOSQ) and an audiological working practices questionnaire. The study included 100 registered U.K. audiologists.\nRESULTS: The research revealed that over a third of participants reported experiencing moderate or higher levels of occupational stress. Pediatric audiologists and those with a high daily patient load reported significantly higher stress scores than other specialties and those seeing fewer patients per day. Identified sources of stress for U.K. audiologists included clinical demands and time constraints, staffing issues, leadership in the workplace, and equipment availability. Reported impacts of stress encompassed mental health issues, fatigue, social life disruptions, and physical health concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS: The research validated the use of the AOSQ in a U.K. setting, and the findings provided insights into the sources and levels of occupational stress experienced by U.K. audiologists, supporting existing research on occupational stress in audiologists in other countries. The identification of consistent stress themes across the literature underscores the need for targeted support and interventions to ensure the well-being of audiologists and empower them in maintaining their pivotal role in health care.\nPMID:\n38963786\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00024",

(2014), the current study aimed to expand the original study's findings-that SoTL was rarely published in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) literature from 2009 to 2013-to the subsequent 8-year period (2014-2021). The latter period was of particular relevance considering the dissolution of one American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)-affiliated publication and the addition of another non-ASHA-affiliated publication during that time.\nMETHOD: Ten peer-reviewed CSD journals and the articles published in them were identified via a survey of the literature that used narrowly defined criteria developed in collaboration with a librarian. Five trained CSD graduate student raters compared a definition of SoTL to article abstracts to determine whether each should have been categorized as SoTL. Part 1 of the study investigated an 8-year time span, Part 2 investigated the remaining nine journals in the subsequent 5 years, and Part 3 investigated publication rates of SoTL in\nTeaching and Learning in Communication Sciences & Disorders\n(\nTLCSD\n) alone.\nRESULTS: Part 1 of the study revealed that publication rates of SoTL were extremely low in the 10 surveyed CSD journals in the 8-year time span investigated. A similar and diminishing trend was found in Part 2. Even smaller percentages of journals were dedicated to SoTL. Part 3 confirmed that relatively large amounts of CSD-specific SoTL have been published in\nTLCSD\nsince its inception in 2017.\nCONCLUSIONS: As of 2021, SoTL articles continued to be uncommonly published in CSD journals. Until recently, scholarly teachers attempting to apply SoTL in the classroom had limited resources. Beginning in 2017,\nTLCSD\nhas provided an outlet for SoTL, whereas other CSD journals seem to have published less of it. Reform of publication, peer review, tenure, and promotion policies and procedures is called for so that SoTL might be included as a valid scientific endeavor.\nPMID:\n38963783\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00234",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Specific learning disorder (SLD) refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by problems with reading, writing, or mathematics that are not solely due to intellectual disabilities, sensory deficits, or other neurological or medical conditions. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the processing and organizing of information. Auditory and cognitive processing is affected in most children with SLD, although to a varying degree. However, it is still unclear whether there exists any relationship between auditory and cognitive processing disorders in children with SLD.\nMETHOD: We tested 1,259 children, of whom 77 were diagnosed as SLD and 30 age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) children were selected. Auditory processing abilities were assessed for auditory discrimination, pattern perception, closure, temporal processing, binaural integration, and separation using standardized tests and procedures. Cognitive processing was measured using working memory, short-term memory, and attention tasks.\nRESULTS: The test data of the TD children were taken as the norm. Based on the normative range, children with SLD were divided into those with auditory processing disorder (APD;\nn\n= 31) and those without APD (\nn\n= 46). A regression model highlighted a robust positive relationship between APD and cognitive processing, particularly pronounced in SLD with APD children. The results are discussed, supporting the information-processing theory of learning disability and highlighting a complex loop between auditory and cognitive deficits in children with SLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the critical role of both auditory and cognitive abilities in children with SLD. Tailoring the intervention to break the loop is recommended, which may improve learning abilities more effectively.\nPMID:\n38959167\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00001",

It is a powerful research tool but can be complex and challenging for beginners. Application of EMA in audiological research brings with it opportunities and challenges that differ from other research disciplines. This tutorial discusses important considerations when conducting EMA studies in hearing care. While more research is needed to develop specific guidelines for the various potential applications of EMA in hearing research, we hope this article can alert hearing researchers new to EMA to pitfalls when using EMA and help strengthen their study design. The current article elaborates study design details, such as choice of participants, representativeness of the study period for participants' lives, and balancing participant burden with data requirements. Mobile devices and sensors to collect objective data on the acoustic situation are reviewed alongside different possibilities for EMA setups ranging from online questionnaires paired with a timer to proprietary apps that also have access to parameters of a hearing device. In addition to considerations for survey design, a list of questionnaire items from previous studies is provided. For each item, an example and a list of references are given. EMA typically provides data sets that are rich but also challenging in that they are noisy, and there is often unequal amount of data between participants. After recommendations on how to check the data for compliance, reactivity, and careless responses, methods for statistical analysis on the individual level and on the group level are discussed including special methods for direct comparison of hearing device programs.\nPMID:\n38950171\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00249",

This study primarily aims to assess the hearing of wrestlers with bilateral cauliflower ears and determine their external ear canal (EEC) resonance frequencies. Our second aim is to evaluate their hearing quality, speech, and spatial perception.\nMETHOD: This study included 28 male wrestlers aged 18-35 years with bilateral cauliflower ears, as well as 27 male participants in the control group with no wrestling history. The participants' hearing thresholds were determined across the frequency range of 125-16000 Hz for air-conduction and 500-4000 Hz for bone conduction. EEC resonance frequencies were measured. Additionally, all participants completed the Turkish version of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) questionnaire.\nRESULTS: Wrestlers with cauliflower ears exhibited significantly higher hearing thresholds, particularly at frequencies above 4000 Hz (\np\n< .05). Analysis of EEC resonance showed a shift to higher frequencies in the second resonance peak of the right ear (\np\n< .001) and the first resonance peak of the left ear (\np\n= .045). SSQ scores revealed that wrestlers had higher spatial perception (\np\n= .046), hearing quality (\np\n= .004), and general scores (\np\n= .042) in comparison to the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blunt traumas in wrestlers, leading to cauliflower ear, can result in hearing loss. Moreover, deformities in the external ear affect the resonance frequencies of the EEC. Therefore, it is crucial to advocate for the use of ear protection equipment among wrestlers. When fitting hearing aids, attention should be given to changes in the EEC resonance frequency.\nPMID:\n38917152\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00277",

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up until June 30, 2023.\nRESULTS: Primary outcomes focused on complete resolution of vertiginous symptoms measured by either a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test. Secondary outcomes included conversion of a positive DH test to a negative DH test exclusively looking at positional nystagmus and assessment of side effects (cervical/back pain, posttreatment dizziness, and nausea). Both outcomes were assessed within a maximum of 4-week follow-up. Following systematic search and review, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs;\np\n= .413) were found. The studies reported on the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared to three other specific RM: Semont, Li, and Gans maneuvers. Results revealed a low to very low certainty of evidence. With the primary outcomes, Epley maneuver was superior to Gans maneuver 24-hr posttreatment but not after 1 week. No significant differences were found between the remaining maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, evidence of low to very low certainty indicates that Epley maneuver is comparable with Semont, Gans, and Li maneuvers for vertiginous symptoms in patients with P-BPPV.

The five conditions consisted of two without spatial information (silence, tasking via headphones) and three with either auditory (refrigerator sound, tasking via speaker) or somatosensory (fan) information. Two of the conditions also included mental tasking (tasking via headphones, tasking via speaker) and differed only in terms of the spatial localizability of the verbal instructions. We used linear mixed-effects modeling to compare pairs of conditions, specifically examining the effects of the availability of spatial cues in the environment. This study was preregistered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2gqcf/).\nRESULTS: Results showed significant effects of frequency in all conditions (\np\n< .05), but the only pairs of conditions that were significantly different were those including tasking in one condition but not the other (e.g., tasking via headphones vs. silence). Post hoc equivalence testing showed that the lack of significance in the other comparisons could be confirmed as not meaningfully different.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the presence of externally localizable sensory information, whether auditory or somatosensory, does not affect measures of gain in RCT to any relevant degree. However, these findings also contribute to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that mental engagement (\"tasking\") does increase gain whether or not it is provided via localizable instructions.\nPMID:\n38896881\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00017",

These participants were assessed using two standard protocols in a randomized order.\nRESULTS: Results from 77 participants (\nM\nage\n= 46 years; 43 women, 34 men) were analyzed. Pearson's correlation coefficient and simple linear regression indicated a statistically significant relationship between crHIT gain output and age (\np\n> .05) for right gain, 1030°/s\n2\n, and left gain, 1005°/s\n2\n. Although a statistically significant relationship was found, the slope was minor, demonstrating that the clinical effect of age on crHIT gain output was insignificant. Furthermore, no statistically significant relationship exists between crHIT gain output and gender (\np\n> .05). Age-dependent normative data were calculated using the 2.5th and 97.5th confidence interval (CI) percentile method. The responses of angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) gain values for crHIT are expected to occur within the range for lower limit reference interval (RI) of 0.85-0.9 and upper limit RI of 1.11-1.18 for 1030°/s\n2\nand lower limit RI of 0.86-0.92 and upper limit RI of 1.13-1.16 for 1005°/s\n2\n. It can be expected that 90% CI of the population with normal lateral SCC functioning will have aVOR gain values that fall within this range.\nCONCLUSION: Despite a statistically significant relationship that exists with aVOR gain output and age, the changes are minor, declining by 0.0088 units per 10 years, justifying the same normative data for all decade age bands.\nPMID:\n38889375\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-22-00190",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Most modern hearing aids (HAs) employ wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and noise reduction (NR) algorithms. It is known that the nonlinear effects of WDRC and NR cause changes to the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an HA. However, the relative contributions of WDRC and NR to the nonlinear effects are not fully understood. The current study investigated (a) whether WDRC or NR dominates the nonlinear effects measured at the output of a digital HA and (b) whether the electroacoustic effectiveness of NR depends on WDRC parameters while input SNR and background noise are systematically varied.\nMETHOD: Test stimuli were Connected Speech Test sentences in multitalker babble noise (2- or 20-talker), presented at input SNRs ranging from -10 to +10 dB. The HA was programmed using multiband WDRC set according to the National Acoustic Laboratories for Nonlinear HA fitting formula 2 prescriptive fits for four standard audiograms and two compression speeds. The NR algorithm of the HA was switched on or off in separate conditions. Nonlinear electroacoustic effects from the WDRC and NR algorithms were assessed by measuring the output SNR of the HA using a phase-inversion technique. To investigate whether there are other factors that may be important besides the output SNR, the Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index were applied to the recordings to generate inferences on aided speech intelligibility and perceived speech quality.\nRESULTS: Results showed that WDRC dominated the net nonlinear effect at low-input SNRs, and the net nonlinear effect of WDRC and NR was reduced at high-input SNRs. Results also showed that the effectiveness of NR depended on compression parameters. The effectiveness of NR was partially explained by the trend of Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index scores, potentially indicating that the Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index scores may capture factors that cannot be captured by the output SNR metric.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the individual signal-processing stages in an HA should not be considered as independent. Electroacoustic evaluation of WDRC and NR algorithms in isolation is not sufficient to capture the combined nonlinear effect of the two algorithms.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25962541.\nPMID:\n38875482\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00011",

The goal of this systematic review was to ascertain the percentage of studies conducted in the United States in the past 2 decades that reported relevant demographic variables.\nMETHOD: Studies were searched across eight databases and clinical trial registries in October 2022. Variations of the following search strings were used to retrieve peer-reviewed published studies and unpublished clinical trials: children, hearing loss, and intervention.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies were reviewed and coded for the following demographic variables: area and type of intervention, participant age, hearing technology data, sample size, gender, race/skin color and ethnicity, primary/home language(s), additional disabilities, parental education, family income, and parental occupation. Results revealed that many demographic variables were remarkably underreported, with parental education, family income, and parental occupation variables being the least reported data.\nCONCLUSIONS: Demographic data can be an important tool for changing disparities related to intervention outcomes. This systematic review suggests that inclusive research practices should be extended to low-literacy or low-economic resources, non-White, and non-English-speaking groups. Inclusion practices coupled with sufficient sample sizes will ultimately aid in identifying hearing health disparities.\nPMID:\n38861427\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00208",

Here, we evaluated one such system from TympaHealth by comparing air conduction thresholds and resultant hearing aid targets and output, measured with the TympaHealth system with those measured using standard audiometry.\nDESIGN: The hearing thresholds of 35 adults were measured using standard audiometry and the TympaHealth system. Each set of thresholds was used to generate NAL-NL2 targets and program a hearing aid. The data from each system were compared.\nRESULTS: Bland-Altman analyses showed overall mean differences between thresholds measured with each system to be small, with 85% of TympaHealth thresholds being within ±5 dB of the standard audiometric thresholds, although TympaHealth thresholds were higher (poorer) than the standard audiometric thresholds. The hearing aid targets and gains generated from the standard audiometric thresholds were lower (less amplification) than those generated from the TympaHealth thresholds but again, mean differences at each frequency were small and likely imperceptible.\nCONCLUSION: These findings support the possibility that valid hearing testing can take place outside of a clinical booth using portable systems like that from TympaHealth, opening up the possibility of testing hearing and fitting hearing aids through pharmacies, opticians, and in care homes.\nPMID:\n38848255\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00002",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to assess how age influences masseter vestibular evoked myogenic potential (mVEMP) parameters by utilizing 500-Hz tone burst stimuli delivered through air conduction.\nMETHOD: The study involved 110 participants ranging from 15 to 60 years of age, grouped into five categories, all of whom had no previous issues related to their vestibular system. The participants were exposed to 500-Hz tone burst stimuli at 125 dB SPL through ER-3A inserts. These stimuli were presented to one ear at a time, with alternating polarity. A Tukey's honestly significant difference test was conducted to compare rectified and unrectified amplitude, along with latencies (P11 and N21) and the asymmetric ratio across all age groups. Additionally, a multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the impact of sex on the study variables.\nRESULTS: All 110 participants (220 ears) in the study provided mVEMP responses, encompassing 100% of the subjects. The results revealed a significant reduction in both amplitude and latency extension for the P11 and N21 peaks. Interestingly, P11 latency was also prolonged in the youngest participants (Group 1), suggesting ongoing maturation of the system even beyond the age of 16 years. Moreover, a significant sex difference was observed in the P11 latencies. However, there were no substantial sex differences (\np\n> .05) in N1 peak latency, peak-to-peak amplitude, rectified amplitude, and asymmetric ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: Changes in structure occur due to degeneration, and the quantity of vestibular sensory hair cells gradually diminishes with age. The rate of decline is faster in semicircular canals compared to end organs, as observed by Merchant et al. (2000). Following a linear degeneration starting at the age of 40 years, a continuous reduction in sensory cells and primary neurons takes place until approximately 40% of vestibular sensory cells are lost by the age of 75 years and insufficient maturation can lead to prolonged peaks and reduced amplitudes compared with those that are considered normal. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the age of the participants when making diagnoses and incorporate relevant correction factors based on age-related reference data.\nPMID:\n38843439\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00264",

The objective of these analyses was to compare AP between those with and without a clinical diagnosis of MCI using a battery of AP measures.\nMETHOD: Data from 274 older adults from the Keys to Staying Sharp randomized clinical trial (NCT03528486) were analyzed. A battery of AP measures in which three domains (temporal processing, binaural processing, and degraded speech understanding) were addressed by six tests was administered. Analyses were registered at https://osf.io/nga4v.\nRESULTS: Those with and without a clinical diagnosis of MCI differed significantly in age,\np\n= .002; pure-tone hearing in the left ear,\np\n= .007; sex,\np\n= .015; and race,\np\n< .001.

Understanding the hearing aid needs of individuals with hearing loss is important to support uptake, use, and outcomes. The current study describes users' perspectives on how hearing aids can be improved.\nMETHOD: A cross-sectional, qualitative, content analysis design was used for an open-ended question from an online survey, exploring user perspectives on hearing aid improvements. Participants were adult hearing aid users in the United States, surveyed from the HearingTracker and Lexie Hearing user database.\nRESULTS: A total of 628 participants (\nM\nage\n= 66 years) were surveyed. The majority of participants used bilateral, behind-the-ear hearing aids that were obtained either through a hearing health care professional or online. Three domains, highlighting areas for hearing aid improvement, were identified. (a) The hearing aid features domain described user issues surrounding physical appearance and fit, general features, streaming, battery functionality, adjustments, smartphone applications, and hearing aid-related accessories. There was dissatisfaction with aesthetics and functionality, with a notable desire for improvements in physical appearance and fit (\nn\n= 161), and features to improve self-efficacy. (b) The sound quality domain described user issues surrounding sound perception and difficult situations. Participants highlighted unmet needs for clarity, especially in noisy environments (\nn\n= 143). (c) The service-delivery domain described user issues surrounding audiology services and general satisfaction, with criticisms centered on the high cost of hearing aids (\nn\n= 193) and the credibility of hearing health care professionals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hearing aid users appreciated current technological advances but expressed a need for improvements, to better align devices with their requirements. Key areas included physical aesthetics, user control over device adjustments, sound clarity, cost accessibility, and trust between the user and hearing health care professional. Future designs should focus on features enhancing user autonomy and self-efficacy.\nPMID:\n38768085\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00245",

Short-term effects between the start and the end of therapy were based on tolerable level of sound exposure (dB SPL), subjective-level hinderance of hyperacusis, and sensitivity to sound using the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). The long-term effect was based on HQ 6 months after the end of therapy. Linear mixed-effects and regression models were applied to study outcomes over time.\nRESULTS: In total, 30 patients, 15 men and 15 women, aged between 24 and 76 years were included in this study. The mean number of sessions during therapy was 6 and ranged between 4 and 8. Results showed an increase of exposure level (mean change was +23.7 dB with an\nSD\nof 7.9,\np\n< .001), a decrease in sensitivity to daily sounds (mean [\nSD\n] change was -1.6 [2.1],\np\n< .001), and a decrease in HQ (mean [\nSD\n] change was -9.8 [4.9],\np\n< .001), between the start and the end of therapy. There was no significant change in HQ after the end of therapy and 6 months later; mean (\nSD\n) change was 0.2 (4.3),\np\n= .81.\nCONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of CSET indicated a decrease in short- and long-term sensitivity to sound in patients with hyperacusis. Additionally, CSET has shown a positive impact, not only for the sounds used in the therapy sessions but also in transferring benefits to everyday sounds. The results of combining psychoeducation, sound exposure, and counseling are promising and warrant further evaluation.\nPMID:\n38768075\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00210",

In this study, we measured the association of drive times to the nearest audiologist with population density, income, ethnicity, race, and distance to the nearest audiology graduate program.\nMETHOD: Drive times for each census block group to the nearest audiologist were measured using census data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and a geographic analyzing tool called ArcGIS for all block groups within the United States. The association between drive times and population density, income, ethnicity, race, and audiology program distance was evaluated with a population density-matched case-control study and multiple linear regression analyses.\nRESULTS: Approximately 5.29 million Americans need to drive at least 1 hr to visit their closest audiologist. The 10% most rural-dwelling Americans drive an average of 33.8 min. The population density-matched case-control study demonstrated that percent below poverty, percent identifying as Hispanic, and travel times to the nearest audiology program were all significantly higher in census block groups with high drive times to the nearest audiologist. An average of 7.96% of individuals in census block groups with low drive times identified as Hispanic, but 18.8% identified as Hispanic in high drive time groups. The multiple linear regression showed that the effect of demographics and distance to the nearest audiology program was highest in rural areas. In both analyses, adjusting for poverty did not drastically change the effect of percent identifying as Hispanic on drive times.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long drive times restrict access to audiological care for those who live in rural areas. This restriction disproportionately affects those in rural areas who identify as Hispanic or have low income.\nPMID:\n38758682\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00279",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Bone conduction hearing devices (BCDs) that deliver sound across the skin (i.e., transcutaneous) are suitable for some individuals who have conductive or mixed hearing losses. Prescriptive targets for percutaneous devices are available, for example, from the Desired Sensation Level-Bone Conduction Hearing Device (DSL-BCD) algorithm. These targets, however, may require modification for use with transcutaneous BCDs. The current study investigated three key variables that may inform target modification: (a) comparison of thresholds measured using an audiometric bone conduction (BC) transducer versus transcutaneous BCDs that offer in situ threshold measurement, (b) transcutaneous BCD default force level outputs versus recommended DSL percutaneous BC targets, and (c) the preferred listening levels (PLLs) of adults wearing transcutaneous BCDs in a laboratory setting.\nMETHOD: Bilateral conductive hearing loss was simulated in 20 normal-hearing adults via earplugs. Thresholds were measured using a B-71 BC transducer and two commercially available BCDs coupled to a soft headband. DSL percutaneous BC targets were generated, and PLLs were obtained for a 60-dB SPL speech stimulus. Force level outputs were measured using a skull simulator on the Audioscan Verifit2 at the hearing aids' default settings and at the participants' PLL for each device.\nRESULTS: On average, audiometric BC thresholds were significantly better than those measured in situ with each BCD. PLLs were similar to prescribed targets for one device with the smoother response shape and agreed in the high frequencies for both devices.\nCONCLUSIONS: In situ thresholds are significantly higher than audiometric BC thresholds, suggesting that device-based in situ measurement more accurately accounts for the signal transmission from transcutaneous BCDs. PLLs differed from the percutaneous targets and varied between devices, which may indicate that either target modifications or manipulations of device frequency response shaping are needed to approximate PLL with transcutaneous BCD devices.\nPMID:\n38748932\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00258",

Integrating interprofessional education experiences into graduate communication sciences and disorders (CSD) programs is essential to cultivate collaborative skills and prepare future professionals for the interprofessional demands of the field. Within this context, peer teaching has emerged as a noteworthy strategy to promote learning. This study aims to contribute to this evolving field by reporting the impact of an interprofessional (speech-language pathology and audiology) peer teaching educational intervention on physician assistant (PA) students' knowledge of speech-language-hearing developmental milestones and developmental screening.\nMETHOD: A quantitative, descriptive methodology with a pretest, posttest interventional design was utilized to assess the impact of a CSD peer-led educational intervention on the knowledge of 35 PA students. The perceived satisfaction of the PA students with the peer-led educational experience was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Data analysis revealed a significant increase on knowledge posttest scores compared to pretest scores. PA students also reported an overall positive peer learning experience.\nCONCLUSION: The collaboration between speech-language pathology, audiology, and PA students through peer teaching holds significant importance in the context of pediatric primary care, and for CSD graduate trainings programs interested in improving educational experiences that tailor to interprofessional learning and practice.\nPMID:\n38748920\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00273",

These measurements allow audiologists to account for the individual's hearing and ear canal acoustics when programming hearing aids. An evidence-based hearing aid fitting includes matching the measured output of the hearing aids to targets for each input level and frequency. This allows the audiologist to confidently counsel the patient that the acoustic fitting is accurate, and the next step is for the individual to use the amplification during all waking hours to adapt to the newly amplified sounds. This also avoids mistakes such as overamplification or insufficient gain, which can endanger the patient and/or lead to a compromised fitting.\nPMID:\n38855348\n| PMC:\nPMC11161218\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0044-1786505",

The parameters of sound that may cause beneficial effects, however, are currently only theorized with limited data supporting their effectiveness. Residual inhibition is the temporary suppression or elimination of tinnitus that is usually observed following appropriate auditory stimulation. Our pilot study investigated the effects of a therapeutic acoustic stimulus that was individually customized to maximize residual inhibition of tinnitus and extend its duration to determine if there could be a sustained suppression of the tinnitus signal (i.e., reduced tinnitus loudness) and a reduction in the psychological and emotional reactions to tinnitus. This pilot study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate the feasibility of residual inhibition technique therapy through daily use of hearing aids and (2) to determine its effects by measuring reactionary changes in tinnitus with the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and perceptual changes in tinnitus loudness. A total of 20 adults (14 males, 6 females; mean age: 58 years, SD = 12.88) with chronic tinnitus were enrolled in a four-visit study that consisted of the following: (1) baseline visit and initiation of the intervention period, (2) a 1-month postintervention visit, (3) 2-month postintervention visit and initiation of a wash-out period, and (4) a 3-month visit to assess the wash-out period and any lasting effects of the intervention. The intervention consisted of fitting bilateral hearing aids and creating an individualized residual inhibition stimulus that was streamed via Bluetooth from a smartphone application to the hearing aids. The participants were instructed to wear the hearing aids and stream the residual inhibition stimulus all waking hours for the 2-month intervention period. During the wash-out period, the participants were instructed to use the hearing aids for amplification, but the residual inhibition stimulus was discontinued. At all visits, the participants completed the TFI, study-specific self-report measures to document perceptions of tinnitus, a psychoacoustic test battery consisting of tinnitus loudness and pitch matching, and a residual inhibition test battery consisting of minimum masking and minimum residual inhibition levels. At the end of the trial, participants were interviewed about the study experience and acceptability of the residual inhibition treatment technique. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted on the two main outcomes (TFI total score and tinnitus loudness) across all four visits. The results showed a significant main effect of visit on the TFI total score (\np\n< 0.0001). Specifically, the results indicated a significant reduction in TFI total scores from baseline to the 1-month post-intervention period, which remained stable across the 2-month post-intervention period and the wash-out period. The ANOVA results did not show a significant change in tinnitus loudness as a function of visit (\np\n= 0.480). The majority of the participants reported a positive experience with the study intervention at their exit interview. This pilot study demonstrated that residual inhibition as a sound therapy for tinnitus, specifically through the daily use of hearing aids, was feasible and acceptable to individuals suffering from chronic tinnitus. In addition, participants showed improvement in reactions to tinnitus as demonstrated by sustained reduction in TFI scores on average over the course of the treatment period. Achieving residual inhibition may also provide patients a feeling of control over their tinnitus, and this may have a synergistic effect in reducing the psychological and emotional distress associated with tinnitus. There was no significant reduction in long-term tinnitus loudness resulting from the residual inhibition treatment; however, the current pilot study may not have had sufficient power to detect such a change. The combination of tinnitus suppression and improved psychosocial/emotional reactions to tinnitus may result in a better quality of life in both the short and long term. A larger-scale study is needed to determine the validity of using residual inhibition as a clinical therapy option and to ascertain any effects on both perception and reactions to tinnitus.\nPMID:\n38370522\n| PMC:\nPMC10872653\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770153",

However, physical and biological constraints ensure that these signals are perceived slightly asynchronously. The brain only recognizes them as simultaneous when they occur within a period of time called the temporal binding window (TBW). Aging can prolong the TBW, leading to temporal uncertainty during multisensory integration. This effect might contribute to imbalance in the elderly but has not been examined with respect to vestibular inputs. Here, we compared the vestibular-related TBW in 13 younger and 12 older subjects undergoing 0.5 Hz sinusoidal rotations about the earth-vertical axis. An alternating dichotic auditory stimulus was presented at the same frequency but with the phase varied to determine the temporal range over which the two stimuli were perceived as simultaneous at least 75% of the time, defined as the TBW. The mean TBW among younger subjects was 286 ms (SEM ± 56 ms) and among older subjects was 560 ms (SEM ± 52 ms). TBW was related to vestibular sensitivity among younger but not older subjects, suggesting that a prolonged TBW could be a mechanism for imbalance in the elderly person independent of changes in peripheral vestibular function.\nPMID:\n38370520\n| PMC:\nPMC10872654\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770137",

We sought to understand tinnitus rehabilitation service needs and preferences among Veterans with bothersome tinnitus who use Veterans Affairs (VA) services. We conducted semistructured telephone interviews in 2019 with Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, who reported it as bothersome. Veterans were purposively sampled to represent national VA users, with and without comorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI), and who were or were not interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services. Qualitative data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Among 40 Veterans interviewed (32 men, 8 women; 50% with TBI), 72.5% endorsed being somewhat/very likely to be interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services while 27.5% were very/somewhat unlikely. Themes related to Veterans' interest in tinnitus rehabilitation services included barriers and facilitators to participation and preferences for receiving tinnitus services (e.g., individual vs. group-based; in-person vs. remote access). Our findings highlight factors that influence Veterans' reported need and preferences for, and readiness to engage in, rehabilitation services for tinnitus.

Many speech-in-noise tests have been developed and used to varying degrees. However, multiple barriers have prevented speech-in-noise testing from being used widely in the clinic. The purpose of this article is to provide a resource to audiologists and other hearing health professionals who want to know (1) what tests are available for use, (2) the rationale behind specific tests, and (3) important considerations when selecting one or more tests to use clinically. In addition, data are presented for four speech-in-noise tests with the purpose of comparing outcomes as a function of age and hearing status. The four tests (QuickSIN, Words in Noise [WIN], Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences [LiSN-S], and Coordinate Response Measure [CRM]) were completed by 30 individuals from three groups: 10 young adults with normal hearing, 10 older adults with normal hearing, and 10 older adults with hearing loss. The results suggest that, despite significant differences in performance between groups, group overlap was present such that some individuals from one group performed similar to some individuals of other groups; therefore, individual performance was more important than associated group. When selecting an appropriate speech-in-noise test to use clinically, audiologists should carefully consider the purpose of their testing and the type of information they desire as an outcome.

It is analogous to ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. OCT has recently been introduced in auditory research to visualize the various structures of the ear with a minimally invasive operation. In addition, OCT can be used as a vibrometry system that is capable to detect sound-induced sub-nanometer vibrations of the middle and inner ear. OCT-vibrometry measures depth-resolved vibrations into the specimen, which overcomes several limitations of classical vibrometry techniques (e.g., single surface point measurements using laser interferometry). In this article, we illustrate how to visualize the anatomy and function of the middle and inner ear (the cochlea) in a gerbil model using recently developed spectral-domain OCT. Our results demonstrate that the largest clinical impact of OCT for otology is to visualize various pathologies and quantify sound conduction and processing in the individual peripheral human ear.\nPMID:\n38370517\n| PMC:\nPMC10872649\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770154",

Severe tinnitus can be associated with negative impacts on daily life. Veterans with severe tinnitus may also have greater difficulties in functional roles, including work. However, few studies have explicitly explored this relationship. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also prevalent among Veterans, is associated with tinnitus and can additionally impair work functioning. This quantitative investigation used a population-based survey to assess the relationship between tinnitus severity, measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the impact of tinnitus on work, measured using a composite score from the Tinnitus History Questionnaire, among a stratified random sample of VA healthcare-using Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, with and without comorbid TBI. Analyses were weighted to account for sampling design and Veteran non-response; multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Results indicated that for every 1-point increase in TFI score, there was an average 8% increase in the odds of reporting a high level of impact on work functioning (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.11). Veterans with a comorbid TBI diagnosis, compared with those without, were more likely to have high tinnitus-related impact on work functioning (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.85, 3.91), but the relationship between tinnitus severity and the impact of tinnitus on work functioning did not differ by TBI status.

However, the impaired sensory and/or cognitive mechanisms underlying these auditory difficulties are largely unknown. This work used a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological measures to explore how neural stimulus discrimination and processing speed contribute to impaired temporal processing in blast-exposed Veterans measured using the behavioral Gaps-in-Noise (GIN) Test. Results confirm previous findings that blast exposure can impact performance on the GIN and effect neural auditory discrimination, as measured using the P3 auditory event-related potential. Furthermore, analyses revealed correlations between GIN thresholds, P3 responses, and a measure of behavioral reaction time. Overall, this work illustrates that behavioral responses to the GIN are dependent on both auditory-specific bottom-up processing beginning with the neural activation of the cochlea and auditory brainstem as well as contributions from complex neural networks involved in processing speed and task-dependent target detection.\nPMID:\n38370515\n| PMC:\nPMC10872670\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770139",

This study aimed to evaluate changes in attenuation over time for properly fit devices when worn by workers exposed to hazardous noise. Earplug fit testing was accomplished on 30 workers at a brewery facility with three types of foam and three types of premolded earplugs. The personal attenuation ratings (PARs) were measured before and after a 2-hour work period while exposed to hazardous noise levels. The minimum acceptable initial PAR was 15 dB. Average decreases in PAR ranged from -0.7 to -2.6 dB across all six earplug types. Significant changes in PAR were observed for the Foam-1 (\np\n= 0.009) and Premold-3 (\np\n= 0.004) earplugs. A linear mixed regression model using HPD type and study year as fixed effects and subject as random effect was not significant for either fixed effect (\nα\n= 0.05). Ninety-five percent of the final PAR measurements maintained the target attenuation of 15 dB. Properly fitting earplugs can be effective at reducing worker's noise exposures over time. The potential for a decrease in attenuation during the work shift should be considered when training workers and establishing the adequacy of protection from hazardous noise exposures.\nPMID:\n37818150\n| PMC:\nPMC10562054\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1769586",

However, clear evidence is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine if sudden sensorineural hearing loss is associated with COVID-19 illness or its vaccine.\nMETHODS: Retrospective chart review of fifty randomly selected patients from three, 6-month time periods: \"pre-pandemic\", \"early pandemic\", and \"late pandemic\". Group comparisons were performed for demographics, comorbid conditions, audiologic history, audiometric data, speech reception thresholds, and word recognition.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were included in this study. A mean difference was observed in that the relative percentage of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) cases increased over time, corresponding to a relative decrease in conductive hearing loss cases. However, this change was not explained by proportional changes in sudden SNHL. Patients in the early pandemic time period were more likely to report tinnitus. Otherwise, the patient groups did not differ on demographic variables, hearing health history, hearing loss presentation, pure tone averages, speech reception thresholds, or word recognition performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proportion of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss did not change over time from the pre-pandemic period to the early or late pandemic phases. Despite a randomized sample, these findings do not support the hypothesis that COVID-19 illness or vaccine is associated with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38880092\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539791",

Individuals' auditory attention, working memory, and auditory processing skills were assessed in the study, and self-report questionnaires were used. The evaluation utilized the Sustained Auditory Attention Capacity Test (SAACT), Working Memory Scale (WMS), Filtered Words Test, Auditory Figured Ground Test (AFGT), and the Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS). Analyses were conducted, including group comparisons, correlation examinations, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) evaluations.\nRESULTS: There were significant differences in CHAPS total, attention, noise, quiet, and multiple inputs between groups. No significant differences were seen in CHAPS_ideal and CHAPS_auditory memory across groups. The study of SAACT and its subscores, WMS and its subscores, FWT, and AFGT revealed a significant difference between groups, caused by the poor performance of persons in the HL group compared to those in the NH group. The SAACT and its subscores correlated significantly with CHAPS_attention. The AUC calculation showed that The SAACT and CHAPS_attention distinguished persons with or without hearing loss (p&lt;0.05). WMS_stm and WMS_total correlated with CHAPS auditory memory subscale, however WMS_vwm did not. AUC values for WMS and its subscores showed significant discrimination in identifying children with or without hearing loss (p&lt;0.05), whereas CHAPS_auditory memory did not (AUC=0.665; p=0.060). FWT and AFGT had a significant relationship with CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subscales. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests only correlated with AFGT. CHAPS_quite and CHAPS_ideal did not exhibit significant discriminative values (p&lt;0.05) for identifying children with or without hearing loss, while CHAPS_noise, CHAPS_multiple inputs, FWT, and AFGT did.\nCONCLUSION: The CHAPS_attention subscale could be a trustworthy instrument for assessing auditory attention in children with hearing loss. However, the CHAPS_auditory memory subscale may not be suitable for testing working memory. While performance-based auditory processing tests showed improved discrimination, the CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subtests can still assess hearing-impaired auditory processing. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests may not evaluate auditory processing.\nPMID:\n38880084\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539570",

The preservation of auditory neuronal and sensory neural hearing cells has a positive impact on auditory perception after implantation. This study aimed to provide details on a semi-automated spiral ganglion neuronal cell counting method, developed using whole implanted gerbil cochlea acquisitions with light sheet microscopy.\nMETHODS: Mongolian gerbils underwent right cochlear implantation with an electrode array whose silicone was loaded with dexamethasone or not and were euthanized 10 weeks after implantation. The cochleae were prepared according to a 29-day protocol, with the electrode array in place. Light sheet microscopy was used for acquisition, and Imaris software was employed for three-dimensional analysis of the cochleas and semi-automatic quantification of spiral ganglion cells. The imaJ software was used for manual quantification of these cells.\nRESULTS: Six cochleae were acquired by light-sheet microscopy, allowing good identification of cells. There was no significant difference between the mean number of spiral ganglion cell obtained by manual and semi-automatic counting (p = 0,25).\nCONCLUSION: Light sheet microscopy provided complete visualization of the spiral ganglion and cell identification. The semi-automated counting method developed using Imaris software tools proved reliable and efficient and could be applied to a larger sample to assess post-cochlear implant cell damage and the efficacy of protective drugs delivered to the inner ear.\nPMID:\n38810615\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539569",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND: Many studies have shown increased academic problems in children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL). However, whether hearing devices can ameliorate the educational difficulties associated with UHL is not well studied. Therefore, the objective of the current systematic review was to answer the question: Do non-surgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, and/or cochlear implants improve academic outcomes in school-aged children and adolescents with UHL?\nMETHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to 12/21/22. Published, peer-reviewed studies comparing academic outcomes in patients with UHL aged ≥ 5 and ≤ 19 years with and without hearing devices (non-surgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, or cochlear implants) were included. Results of studies were qualitatively synthesized, and the risk of bias was evaluated with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 5,644 non-duplicate publications were identified by the search, and four studies were included for synthesis, every one of which was investigating non-surgical amplification. One small, single-arm study demonstrated significant improvement in subjective classroom listening difficulties after a 3- to 4-month trial with a BTE hearing aid. The other three studies of non-surgical amplification devices showed no benefit across multiple academic outcomes with FM systems and conventional and CROS-style hearing aids.\nDISCUSSION: The small sample sizes, heterogeneous and/or ill-defined study samples, and overall low quality of the available literature ultimately make it hard to draw definitive conclusions regarding non-surgical amplification devices' effectiveness in improving academic outcomes in children with UHL. No articles were identified that studied cochlear implants or bone-anchored hearing aids. Further studies with high-quality study design, large sample sizes, and long-term follow-up are needed to answer this clinically important question.\nPMID:\n38810609\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539513",

The etiology of otosclerosis remains unknown; factors such as infection, hormones, inflammation, genetics, and autoimmunity have been discussed. Treatment consists primarily of surgical stapes replacement and cochlear implantation. High-resolution computed tomography is routinely used to visualize bone pathology. In the present study, we used synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI) to examine otosclerosis plaques in a temporal bone for the first time. The primary aim was to study their three-dimensional (3D) outline, vascular interrelationships, and connections to the middle ear.\nMETHODS: A donated ear from a patient with otosclerosis who had undergone partial stapedectomy with the insertion of a stapes wire prosthesis was investigated using SR-PCI and compared with a control ear. Otosclerotic lesions were 3D rendered using the composite with shading technique. Scalar opacity and color mapping were adjusted to display volume properties with the removal of bones to enhance surfaces. Vascular bone channels were segmented, and the communications between lesions and the middle ear were established.\nRESULTS: Fenestral, cochlear, meatal, and vestibular lesions were outlined three-dimensionally. Vascular bone channels were found to be frequently connected to the middle ear mucosa, perilabyrinthine air spaces, and facial nerve vessels. Round window lesions partly embedded the cochlear aqueduct which was pathologically narrowed, while the inferior cochlear vein was significantly dilated in its proximal part.\nCONCLUSION: Otosclerotic/otospongiotic lesions were imaged for the first time using SR-PCI and 3D rendering. The presence of shunts and abnormal vascular connections to the labyrinth appeared to result in hyper-vascularization, overloading the venous system, and leading to sensorineural hearing loss. We speculate about possible local treatments to alleviate the impact of such critical lesions on the labyrinthine microcirculation.\nPMID:\n38763131\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539422",

The time course of the involved pathologies is still under investigation. Several studies have demonstrated an acute damage of the sensory tissue, but only few experiments investigated the degeneration of (type I) spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), representing the primary neurons in the auditory system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of SGN degeneration within a 7-day period after traumatic noise exposure starting immediately after trauma.\nMETHODS: Young adult normal hearing mice were noise exposed for 3 h with a broadband noise (5-20 kHz) at 115 dB SPL. Auditory threshold shift was measured by auditory brainstem recordings, and SGN densities were analyzed at different time points during the first week after acoustic trauma.\nRESULTS: Significant reduction of SGN densities was detected and is accompanied by a significant hearing loss. Degeneration starts within hours after the applied trauma, further progressing within days post-exposure.\nDISCUSSION: Early neurodegeneration in the auditory periphery seems to be induced by direct overstimulation of the auditory nerve fibers.

These data could potentially provide evidence to encourage more bimodal candidates to continue hearing aid (HA) use after CI.\nMETHODS: In this prospective study, patients completed preoperative and 1-, 3-, and 6-month post-activation QOL surveys on listening effort, speech perception, sound quality/localization, and hearing handicap. Fifteen HA users who were candidates for contralateral CI completed the study (mean age 65.6 years).\nRESULTS: Patients used both devices at a median rate of 97%, 97%, and 98% of the time at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. On average, patients' hearing handicap scores decreased by 16% at 1 month, 36% at 3 months, and 30% at 6 months.

This variability may be related to brain changes associated with intact senses recruiting cortical areas from stimulation-deprived senses. Numerous studies have demonstrated such cross-modal reorganization in individuals with untreated hearing loss. How it is affected by regular use of hearing devices remains unclear, however. To shed light on this, the current study measured cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities in experienced CI users and normal-hearing controls.\nMETHODS: Using multichannel electroencephalography, we tested CI users who had used their devices for at least 12 months and closely matched controls (N = 2 × 13). Cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities - the N400 and late positive complex (LPC) components - were evoked using congruent and incongruent digit-triplet stimuli. The participants' task was to assess digit-triplet congruency by means of timed button presses. All measurements were performed in speech-shaped noise 15 dB above individually measured speech recognition thresholds. Three stimulus presentation modes were used: auditory-only, visual-only, and visual-then-auditory.\nRESULTS: The analyses revealed no group differences in the N400 and LPC responses. In terms of response times, the CI users were slower and differentially affected by the three stimulus presentation modes relative to the controls.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to normal-hearing controls, experienced CI users may need more time to comprehend speech in noise. Response times can serve as a proxy for speech comprehension by CI users.\nPMID:\n38679013\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538701",

A newer Fast method - Italian Fast Speech Reception Threshold 50 (IFastSRT50) - is performed by means of program software with a single list of bisyllabic words and noise intensity shifting.\nRESULTS: Means comparison between SRT50 Classic and IFastSRT50 shows a slight significant correlation (r = 0.263; p = 0.044) and a wide significant difference: SRT50 Classic = -2.763 dB (SD = 4.1) and IFastSRT50 = -7.803 dB (SD = 2.1) (p &lt; 0.0001). There is a high difference between the test execution time means (SRT50 Classic = 11 min, IFastSRT50 = 2 min; p &lt; 0.0001). The correlation between test results and execution times was higher for SRT50 Classic than IFastSRT50.\nCONCLUSION: IFastSRT50 test is a reliable method to quickly investigate signal-to-noise ratio needed to obtain 50% of recognition scores with bisyllabic words; it allows less execution time than SRT50 Classic method and can avoid patient fatigue and other limitations of different speech discrimination tests in noise as sentences based ones.\nPMID:\n38631316\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538556",

The study encompassed the assessment of the clinical presentation, treatment, quality of life, and evolution after treatment of the identified individuals.\nRESULTS: During the study period, six patients, aged between 33 and 71 years, developed vestibular ototoxicity following the use of topical aminoglycoside drops due infection flares in chronic otitis media. All cases involved the use of gentamicin. Two cases were unilateral, and four were unilateral. The onset of symptoms occurred within one to four weeks of using the drops, resulting in all patients experiencing instability without vertigo attacks. After discontinuing the drops and undergoing vestibular rehabilitation, four patients experienced sequelae, with two patients (both with bilateral vestibular hypofunction) suffering significant impairment in their quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Vestibular ototoxicity due to the topical application of aminoglycosides during acute exacerbations of chronic otitis media is a rare occurrence. However, given its potential for severe consequences and the fact that we are still encountering patients with this condition, healthcare professionals should explore alternative antibacterial agents that offer similar efficacy.\nPMID:\n38588647\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538756",

The aim of this study was to assess whether COPD is associated with hearing loss that affects speech recognition.\nMETHODS: This is a case-control study. We screened individuals from health facilities in the municipality of Jundiai. We enrolled a test group of individuals with COPD and an age-matched control group composed of individuals with asthma. The selected individuals attended an appointment with a chest physician, responded questionnaires and underwent tonal and speech audiometry. Adjusted binary logistic regression analysis evaluated whether COPD was associated with reduced speech recognition.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 36 individuals with COPD and 72 with asthma. Individuals with COPD were more likely to have a reduced speech recognition compared to asthmatic individuals [Reduced recognition of three-syllable words: adjusted OR 3.72, 95 CI (1.38 - 10.02)] [Reduced recognition of monosyllable words: adjusted OR 4.74, 95 CI (1.52 - 14.76)].\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that individuals with COPD from primary and secondary healthcare facilities have at least 38% greater risk of hearing loss with reduced speech recognition compared to an age-matched control group of individuals with asthma recruited from the same facilities.

Here, we aim to evaluate the predictive power of aided pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in quiet, and establish cut-off values for both tests that indicate whether auditory performance in noise can be assessed using the Matrix sentence test in a diffuse noise environment.\nMETHODS: Here, we assessed the power of pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in quiet to predict the response to the MT. Ninety-eight cochlear implant recipients were assessed using different sound processors from Advanced Bionics (n=56) and Cochlear (n=42). Auditory tests were performed at least 1-year after cochlear implantation or upgrading the sound processor to ensure the best benefit of the implant. Auditory assessment of the implanted ear in free-field conditions included: pure-tone average (PTA), speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet at 65 dB, and speech recognition threshold (SRT) in noise that is the SNR at which the patient can correctly recognize 50% of the words using the MT in a diffuse sound field.\nRESULTS: The SRT in noise was determined in sixty patients (61%) and undetermined in 38 (39%) using the MT. When cut-off values for PTA <36 dB and SDS >41% were used separately, they were able to predict a positive response to the MT in 83% of recipients; using both cut-off values together, the predictive value reached 92%.\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: As the pure-tone audiometry is standardized universally and the speech recognition in quiet could vary depending on the language used; we propose that the MT should be performed in recipients with PTA <36 dB, and in recipients with PTA >36 dB, a list of Matrix sentences at a fixed SNR should be presented to determine the percentage of words understood. This approach should enable clinicians to obtain information about auditory performance in noise whenever possible.\nPMID:\n38527427\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000535622",

We conducted a dynamic, ambidirectional cohort study involving 148 subjects at risk of dysphagia in a tertiary university hospital. Our aim was to determine the risk of pneumonia attributed to alterations in swallowing safety detected during FEES. We used multivariate negative binomial regression models to adjust for potential confounders. The incidence density rate (IR) of pneumonia in patients with tracheal aspiration of any consistency was 26.6/100 people-years (RR 7.25; 95% CI: 3.50-14.98; P < 0.001). The IR was 19.7/100 people-years (RR 7.85; 95% CI: 3.34-18.47; P < 0.001) in those with laryngeal penetration of any consistency and 18.1/100 people-years (RR 6.24; 95% CI: 2.58-15.09; P < 0.001) in those with pharyngeal residue of any consistency. When adjusted for aspiration, the association of residue and penetration with pneumonia disappeared, suggesting that their risk of pneumonia is dependent on the presence of aspiration and that only aspiration is independently associated with pneumonia. This increased risk of pneumonia was significant in uni- and multivariate negative binomial regression models. We found an independently increased risk of pneumonia among patients with dysphagia and aspiration detected during FEES. Alterations in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, without aspiration, did not increase the risk of pneumonia.\nPMID:\n38958706\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10727-w",

However, the psychosocial effect of an individual's dysphagia on those that care for them is less known. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically efficient, statistically robust companion-reported outcomes measure to the Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI) to better understand the impact of a patient's dysphagia on their companions as related to physical, emotional and functional domains of health-related quality of life. Seventy-seven initial statements describing companion perceptions of dysphagia were divided into physical, emotional and functional subscales. The statements were administered to 75 consecutive companions of individuals with dysphagia. Respondents replied never, almost never, sometimes, almost always and always to each statement and rated their companion's dysphagia severity on a 7-point equal appearing interval scale. Cronbach's α was performed to assess the internal consistency validation of the statements. The final questionnaire was reduced to 25 items and administered to 317 companions of individuals with dysphagia and 31 controls. Test-retest was performed on 29 companions of individuals with dysphagia. Cronbach's α was strong for the initial and final versions at r = 0.96 and r = 0.97 respectively. Significant differences occurred between companion responses of subjects with dysphagia and the control group. Test-retest reliability was strong (all ICC > 0.85).

An Australian regional health service audit revealed that patients with COPD are frequently referred to speech pathology during acute admissions, rather than proactively to mitigate the risk of dysphagia-related consequences. Referral patterns to speech pathology using a novel transdisciplinary approach for identifying at risk for dysphagia patients in a PRP were explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a transdisciplinary dysphagia screening questionnaire on speech pathology referrals within a cohort of patients with COPD enrolled in a PRP. This quasi-experimental study introduced a dysphagia screening questionnaire in a PRP using a transdisciplinary approach. A retrospective audit of PRP patients (n = 563) between 01/01/2014 and 31/12/2018 was conducted to identify the frequency of referrals to speech pathology for dysphagia. Data was compared to a cohort of patients (n = 50) enrolled in the PRP (from 01/02/21 to 30/11/21) after introduction of the questionnaire using Fisher's exact test. Less than 1% (n = 4/563) of PRP patients were referred to speech pathology prior to implementation of the questionnaire. Following the implementation, referrals to speech pathology significantly increased to 16% (8/50) (X\n2\n= 7.72, P < 0.05; odds ratio = 7.89 95% CI [1.94, 32.1]). Introducing a dysphagia screening questionnaire increased referrals to speech pathology from a PRP. This study demonstrated the potential for a transdisciplinary approach in early screening for patients at risk of dysphagia for patients with COPD. Further research is encouraged to explore patient motivation towards speech pathology input with COPD-related dysphagia and clinicians' perceived self-efficacy in using the questionnaire.\nPMID:\n38951236\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10713-2",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nAround 80% of persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) present symptoms of dysphagia. Although cognitive impairment may contribute to dysphagia, few studies have investigated the association between the PD neuropsychological profile and objective measures of swallowing dysfunction. Since the swallowing function comprises involuntary but also voluntary actions, we hypothesize that specific measures of attention and executive functions can be underlined in PD-related dysphagia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to extensively investigate the correlation and the relationship between attentive and executive functions and safety/efficiency of pharyngeal phase of swallowing in people with PD. All participants received a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and were evaluated using the Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS); the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (IT-YPRSRS), and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS-IT). Participants also underwent a neuropsychological assessment covering global cognitive status, attention, and frontal executive functions. Correlations and associations between neuropsychological measures and swallowing components were calculated. Twenty-one participants with PD (mean age 69.38 ± 6.58 years, mean disease duration 8.38 ± 5.31 years; mean MDS-UPDRS III 43.95 ± 24.18) completed all evaluations. The most significant correlations were found between attentive functions (i.e., Stroop Time), and executive functions (i.e., Raven's Progressive Matrices, Digit Backward and Semantic Fluency), and FOIS-IT, PAS, and IT-YPRSRS sinuses and valleculae. These associations were not influenced by disease duration. These results suggest that a dysfunction to attentional processes and/or to executive functions can contribute to penetration and the presence of pharyngeal residue in participants with middle-stage PD.\nPMID:\n38951235\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10728-9",

The Dynamic Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) is an EBP tool developed in 2016 for videofluoroscopy in head and neck (H&N) oncology with clinical implementation as a goal. We sought to examine: (1) feasibility of clinical implementation of DIGEST in a national comprehensive cancer center, and (2) fidelity of DIGEST adoption in real-world practice. A retrospective implementation evaluation was conducted in accordance with the STARI framework. Electronic health record (EHR) databases were queried for all consecutive modified barium swallow (MBS) studies conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2016 to 2021. Implementation outcomes included: feasibility as measured by DIGEST reporting in EHR (as a marker of clinical use) and fidelity as measured by accuracy of DIGEST reporting relative to the decision-tree logic (penetration-aspiration scale [PAS], residue, and Safety [S] and Efficiency [E] grades). Contextual factors examined included year, setting, cancer type, MBS indication, and provider. 13,055 MBS were conducted by 29 providers in 7,842 unique patients across the lifespan in diverse oncology populations (69% M; age 1-96 years; 58% H&N cancer; 10% inpatient, 90% outpatient). DIGEST was reported in 12,137/13,088 exams over the 6-year implementation period representing 93% (95% CI: 93-94%) adoption in all exams and 99% (95% CI: 98-99%) of exams excluding the total laryngectomy population (n = 730). DIGEST reporting varied modestly by year, cancer type, and setting/provider (> 91% in all subgroups, p < 0.001). Accuracy of DIGEST reporting was high for overall DIGEST (incorrect SE profile 1.6%, 200/12,137), DIGEST-safety (incorrect PAS 0.4% 51/12,137) and DIGEST-efficiency (incorrect residue 1.2%, 148/12,137). Clinical implementation of DIGEST was feasible with high fidelity in a busy oncology practice across a large number of providers. Adoption of the tool across the lifespan in diverse cancer diagnoses may motivate validation beyond H&N oncology.\nPMID:\n38935170\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10721-2",

This study aims to determine the voice parameters that can predict the risk of dysphagia and to determine optimal cutoff values in individuals with multiple sclerosis (IwMS). Seventy-six adults participated in the study, including 39 IwMS and 37 healthy individuals (HI). The study used the Dysphagia in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire (DYMUS), Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS), and Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) and recorded voice samples using Praat programme. Voice recordings were taken pre- and post-swallowing. The voice parameters analysed are fundamental frequency (F0), standard deviation F0 (SD F0), jitter (local), shimmer (local), and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR). Roc analysis was performed to examine the diagnostic accuracy performance of the risk for dysphagia/penetration. The parameters of IwMS pre-swallowing differed significantly from those of HI on the VHI-10, DYMUS, GUSS scores, and jitter (local), shimmer (local), and HNR. IwMS but not HI exhibited significant differences in shimmer (local) and HNR between the pre- and post-swallowing measurements. In IwMS, GUSS revealed significant differences in shimmer (local) pre- and post-swallowing between the groups with and without dysphagia/penetration. In the ROC analysis results, the area under the curve (AUC) for shimmer (local) pre-swallowing was 73.1% (cutoff = 1.69); post-swallowing, it was 78.6% (cutoff = 1.57). In conclusion, IwMS can be associated with differences in shimmer (local) and HNR parameters, low quality of life-related to voice, and dysphagia/penetration risk. The AUC values for shimmer (local) in IwMS pre- and post-swallowing may help to strengthen diagnostic decisions of dysphagia risk.\nPMID:\n38872058\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10720-3",

Risk of aspiration pneumonia or even death is very high in these populations. However, screening for dysphagia risk in these patients is complicated by the fact that most of them suffer from cognitive impairments and behavioral manifestations that hinder the assessment process using the existing screening tests. The aim of this study was to validate the Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals, in patients with cognitive impairment (dementia/intellectual disability) or with severe mental illness (schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder). For this purpose, 148 institutionalized patients were evaluated by professionals responsible for their food intake. The Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals was used to assess its validity in screening for oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients with cognitive impairments and in patients with severe mental illness. Also, the Eating Assessment Tool-10 and the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire were used for convergent reliability procedures. Four comparison groups were established: patients with cognitive impairment with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia, and patients with severe mental illness with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia. Results from the Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals adequately distinguished between groups with and without dysphagia, in addition to presenting adequate levels of convergent validity and reliability. These results were obtained from other-reports (professionals responsible for patients' food intake), using a simple, quickly applied test that does not require the use of food in patients with an altered cognitive state or with severe mental illness. With this study we expand the validity of the Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals in populations with severe cognitive deficits and mental illness in which there is a great deficiency of oropharyngeal dysphagia screening instruments.\nPMID:\n38872057\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10707-0",

To evaluate if a modification for the FEES exam by swallowing an empty capsule and screening of the upper esophagus could be used for early detection of esophageal dysphagia. A prospective, single-center, pilot study. At the end of a standard FEES exam, the patients were asked to swallow an empty capsule. Fifteen seconds later, the endoscope was inserted into the upper esophagus. A pathological capsule test was defined when the capsule was seen in the esophagus. In such cases, the patient was advised to undergo a gastroscopy, MBS, or esophageal manometry, which were compared to the results of the capsule test. The capsule test was utilized in 109 patients.

Previous validation studies found a cutoff value of 3 > swallows as pathological. The aims of this study were to establish the normative values of the RSST and to examine the effect of clinical factors on RSST scores in healthy adults. A cross-sectional study of 280 adults. An equal number of females and males were recruited for each decade of life, ages 20 to 90 years. Patients reporting swallowing difficulties, history of neurologic disorders, or head and neck surgery or radiation were excluded. Data collected included RSST scores, number and type of comorbidities, number of prescribed medications, body mass index, smoking habits, and self-assessment xerostomia questionnaire. The mean RSST score for the entire cohort was 7.01 ± 2.86. Males had a higher RSST score (7.6 ± 3.04 compared to 6.47 ± 2.56, p = 0.001). Age showed an inverse correlation with RSST scores (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = -0.463, p < 0.0001), as well as body mass index, BMI (PCC = -0.2, p < 0.0001), number of co-morbidities (PCC=-0.344, p < 0.0001) and number of prescribed medications (PCC= -0.425, p < 0.0001). Self-reported amount of saliva positively correlated (PCC = 1.05, p = 0.04) with RSST scores. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Age, sex, BMI, and number of prescribed medications were found as significant independent factors on RSST scores. RSST scores in healthy adults decline with age and are lower in females, individuals taking multiple medications and with higher BMI. Mean RSST for all age groups did not fall beneath the previously established pathological cut-off.\nPMID:\n38847841\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10702-5",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe assessment of pharyngeal residues during fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is based on visual-perceptual scales that involve clinical subjectivity. Training might be helpful to increase agreement among clinicians. This paper aims to assess the efficacy of training for the assessment of pharyngeal residue in FEES frames and videos through the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPRSRS). Twenty-nine clinicians (Phoniatricians, Otorhinolaryngologists, Speech and Language Pathologists) and 47 students in Speech and Language Pathology participated in this study. Fourteen clinicians were randomly allocated to the training group, whilst the remaining 15 served as a control group; all the students participated in the training. Participants scored 30 pairs of videos and frames using the YPRSRS twice, before and after the training for the training groups and at least two weeks apart for the control group. Construct validity, defined as the agreement between each rater and the experts' scores, and inter-rater reliability were compared among the groups and between the first and the second assessments to verify the efficacy of the training. Construct validity significantly improved at the second assessment in the training group for the pyriform sinuses videos (baseline 0.71 ± 0.04, post-training 0.82 ± 0.05, p = .049) and in the students' group for the valleculae (baseline 0.64 ± 0.02, post-training 0.84 ± 0.02, p < .001) and pyriform sinuses videos (baseline 0.55 ± 0.03, post-training 0.77 ± 0.02, p < .05). No significant differences were found in the inter-rater reliability in any group. In conclusion, the training seems to improve participants' agreement with experts in scoring the YPRSRS in FEES videos.\nPMID:\n38847840\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10725-y",

The primary objectives of the present study were to explore patients' narrative reports focused on what information and evaluation and treatment experiences they identified as they manage dysphagia, and to identify practice patterns relevant to dysphagia management. A secondary objective was to produce an educational resource for this population that addressed their questions about dysphagia. A sample of individuals with oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to PD (n = 25) across all regions of the United States were interviewed using open- and closed questions and a written questionnaire. Verbatim interview transcripts were interrogated using qualitative content analysis (QCA) with an inductive approach to identify themes from the participants' reported knowledge of dysphagia and experiences with swallowing evaluation and treatment. Authors developed a pamphlet addressing common questions that participants posed in the interviews and conducted a member check to revise it with their feedback. Most participants reported having been asked about their swallowing function by a healthcare professional. 60% of the sample reported having had a swallowing evaluation. Only 20% (5/25) of participants reported having completed swallowing therapy. Some participants did not know that swallowing therapy exists. Nearly all participants reported having a strong desire to know more about dysphagia and preferred a pamphlet as a resource format. Few of the study participants had received swallowing therapy, and nearly all participants were eager to learn about the nature of dysphagia, its progression, and treatment options. Given the physical, emotional, and social ramifications of living with dysphagia, access to swallowing education and treatment needs to be a stronger focus of PD management.\nPMID:\n38839626\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10723-0",

A more nuanced understanding of the psychosocial experiences of this population may assist clinicians in providing a patient-centered approach to care. Our study was designed to gather insight into the common psychosocial experiences associated with dysphagia in the context of PD. A semi-structured interview consisting of open- and closed items was conducted with 25 individuals from regions across the country with self-reported oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to PD. Questions were developed using comprehensive stress and coping frameworks that emphasized psychosocial predictors of specific affective reactions (e.g., grief, anxiety, depression), including self-evaluation (e.g., self-identity), coping strategies, social support, personal expectations (including perceived control over symptoms and prognosis), positive experiences, and perceptions of personal growth. Interview responses were subjected to a qualitative analysis and revealed three dominant themes: (1) Recalibration of a PD Diagnosis, (2) Vigilant Caution to Swallowing, and (3) Grieving the Loss of the Communal Meal. Using these data interpretations, we discuss three concepts for speech-language pathologists working with individuals with dysphagia and PD to consider during clinical interactions; these are reframing swallowing vigilance to engagement with mindful eating, using biofeedback to align patient perceptions and swallow physiology, and understanding the consequences of loss (of their former swallowing ability) through grief and growth reactions.\nPMID:\n38839625\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10722-1",

This is driven by barriers to dysphagia evaluation in this complex care environment. Therefore, we assessed the reliability of trained, non-clinical ED research staff in administering dysphagia screening tools compared to trained speech pathologists (SLPs). We also aimed to determine perceptual screening discrepancies (e.g. voice change) between clinical and non-clinical staff. Forty-two older adults with suspected pneumonia were recruited during an ED visit and underwent dysphagia (Toronto Bedside Swallow Screening Tool; TOR-BSST©) and aspiration (3-oz water swallow test; 3-oz WST) screening by trained non-clinical research staff. Audio-recordings of screenings were re-rated post-hoc by trained, blinded SLPs with discrepancies resolved via consensus. Cohen's kappa (unweighted) revealed moderate agreement in pass/fail ratings between clinical and non-clinical staff for both the TOR-BSST© (k = 0.75) and the 3 oz WST (k = 0.66) corresponding to excellent sensitivity and good specificity for both the TOR-BSST (SN = 94%, SP = 85%) and the 3 oz WST (SN = 90%, SP = 81%). Further analysis of TOR-BSST perceptual parameters revealed that most discrepancies between clinicians and non-clinicians resulted from over-diagnosis of change in vocal quality (53%). These results support the feasibility of non-clinical research staff administering screening tools for dysphagia and aspiration in the ED. Dysphagia screening may not necessitate clinical staff involvement, which may improve feasibility of large-scale ED research. Future training of research staff should focus on perceptual assessment of vocal quality.\nPMID:\n38816522\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10710-5",

The review included observational, experimental, descriptive, and analytical studies and excluded those that were not available in full, animal studies, in vitro studies, letters to the editor, errata, study protocols, and those that used ultrasound for purposes other than swallowing. There were no language and time restrictions. Two independent blinded professionals selected 81 articles that met the inclusion criteria from different databases. The most evaluated parameters included tongue morphology and movements, hyoid bone displacement, swallowing muscle area, and pharyngeal residue detection, such as pharyngeal wall mobility. They used convex and linear transducers (3 MHz to 8 MHz) positioned in the submental, laryngeal, and lateral regions of the neck. The subjects were seated and instructed to eat different food volumes and consistencies. The literature mapping showed that ultrasound is a promising diagnostic tool, helping clinicians understand swallowing disorders, as it provides static and dynamic images in different modes and positions.

However, the preparedness of these disciplines to effectively address PFD is relatively unknown.\nMETHODS: A national (US), online survey was disseminated to providers who assess and treat PFD. For the present analysis, the responses of SLPs (N = 418) and OTs (N = 195) related to their clinical background, educational background, post-graduate training, and self-rated clinical effectiveness were statistically analyzed and compared across the two disciplines.\nRESULTS: Both SLPs and OTs report feeling underprepared to work with PFD clients immediately following their academic training, but time spent in post-graduate training and years of clinical practice both significantly (p < 0.0001) increased feelings of effectiveness in assessing and treating PFD. Most SLPs and OTs pursued self-directed learning activities to increase competence, with the most common activities being article review, podcasts, and peer case review, although SLPs were significantly more likely to use podcasts (p < 0.0001) and peer review (p = 0.0004) than OTs. The most common barriers for providers were financial, time, travel, and institutional support barriers.\nCONCLUSIONS: While PFD is a key practice area of both SLPs and OTs, both provider groups feel unprepared and under-supported in providing competent care to these patients upon graduation.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nB-mode ultrasound is a safe noninvasive procedure that has been used to characterize aspects of the oropharyngeal swallow. The submental suprahyoid muscles are often investigated with ultrasound because of their contributions to hyolaryngeal elevation. There are several techniques for positioning the ultrasound transducer in the coronal plane, however, there is limited research on how reliability of measurement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the geniohyoid differs across transducer placement technique. This study examined three methods of transducer placement in the coronal plane by two examiners to determine the reliability of measurement of CSA of the geniohyoid muscle. Forty healthy adults participated in the study. Each participant's geniohyoid muscles were imaged using B-mode ultrasound under three transducer placement conditions in the coronal plane by two examiners. Geniohyoid CSA was measured from each ultrasound image. A three-way mixed-methods ANOVA was used to determine whether there were significant differences in geniohyoid CSA among transducer position conditions, trials, and examiners. There were significant differences among the transducer placement conditions, indicating that each condition was measuring a different portion of the muscle. There were no significant differences among repeated trials nor between examiners within each method of transducer placement. All three conditions of transducer placement were reliable at measuring geniohyoid CSA across trials and examiners. This study emphasizes the need for consistency of placement, whichever method is selected. It also highlights the need for researchers to provide a precise description of methods for positioning the transducer so that placement is reproducible.\nPMID:\n38789680\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10712-3",

Dysphagia has been identified as a risk and predictive factor for the severest form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between swallowing disorders and COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\nMETHODS: We collected demographic data, medical information specific to dysphagia and data on medical treatments of patients with COVID-19.\nRESULTS: A total of 43 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty (46%) were evaluated positive for dysphagia and 23 (54%) were evaluated negative. Neurocognitive disorders and diabetes were mostly associated with patients who resulted positive for dysphagia. Respiratory impairment caused by COVID-19 seems to be a cause of dysphagia, since all patients who needed oxygen-therapy developed symptoms of dysphagia, unlike patients who did not. In the dysphagic group, alteration of the swallowing trigger resulted in the severest form of dysphagia. An association was found between the severest form of COVID-19 and dysphagia. This group consisted predominantly of males with longer hospitalization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Identification of COVID-19 patients at risk for dysphagia is crucial for better patient management.\nPMID:\n38782803\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10715-0",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThickening agents effectively prevent liquid aspiration, but their impact on the ease of discharging aspirated liquids from the trachea remains unclear due to alterations in the physical properties of liquids. This study clarifies the effects of thickening agents, comprising various raw materials, on mucociliary transport function, focusing on the viscosities of thickened waters. The subjects were 23 healthy adults. Five types of saccharin solution were prepared: a solution without a thickening agent, a starch-based nectar-like solution, a starch-based honey-like solution, a xanthan-gum-based nectar-like solution, and a xanthan-gum-based honey-like solution. Using these five types of saccharin solutions randomly, each subject underwent five trials of the saccharine dye test to evaluate the mucociliary transport function of the respiratory tract. The saccharin time was defined as the time from the placement of the saccharin solution on the nasal vestibule of the subject to when the subject reported that they became aware of the sweetness. The saccharin transit times for all samples of thickened water were longer compared to those of water without a thickening agent (p < 0.01). A comparison between thickened water samples with different viscosities showed that the saccharin transit time was longer when thickened water samples with high viscosity were prepared using the same thickening agent (p < 0.01). This suggests that while thickening reduces aspiration, the use of thickening agents may increase the difficulty in discharging aspirated fluids from the trachea.\nPMID:\n38777870\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10704-3",

Seven studies met the search criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. For each participant, individual accuracy scores for the comprehension of personal and reflexive pronouns were extracted in addition to information on the study methods. Individual accuracy data were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and the binomial test. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis had three main findings: (a) The majority of the persons with agrammatic aphasia (89%) had no dissociation between the comprehension of personal and reflexive pronouns; (b) 8% revealed a pattern consistent with a neuropsychological dissociation, faring worse on the comprehension of personal than reflexive pronouns; and (c) 2% performed worse on reflexive than personal pronouns. The type of the task used affected pronoun comprehension accuracy and accounted for the heterogeneity in the patterns of pronoun comprehension attested across the different participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the meta-analysis did not support a dissociation between personal and reflexive pronoun comprehension in agrammatic comprehension. When confirmed, the dissociation was driven by task effects. The clinical implications of these findings were discussed together with implications to minimize the risk of bias in future examinations of the topic.\nPMID:\n38968276\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00343",

The primary purpose of this preliminary study was to examine the within-word silent interval associated with the stop closure in word-final stop consonants produced by children with and without neurodevelopmental disorders.\nMETHOD: Seven children diagnosed with either cerebral palsy or Down syndrome (i.e., children with neurodevelopmental disorders) and eight typically developing children produced a reading passage. Participants were between the ages of 11 and 16 years. Fifty-eight words from the reading passage were identified as having word-final stop consonants. The closure duration of the word-final stop consonant was calculated, both in absolute duration and percent pause time. The articulation rate of the entire passage was calculated. The number of closure durations that met or exceeded the minimum duration threshold to be considered a pause (150 ms) was examined descriptively.\nRESULTS: Children with neurodevelopmental disorders produced significantly longer closure durations and significantly slower articulation rates than typically developing children. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders produced closure durations that met or exceeded the minimum duration threshold of a pause, but typically developing children, generally, did not.\nCONCLUSION: These data indicate the need to examine the location of silent intervals that meet the minimum duration threshold of a pause and correct for articulatory events during the measurement of articulation rate and pauses in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.\nPMID:\n38963752\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00183",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Ableism is a pervasive set of beliefs that regard nondisabled bodies and minds as ideal and necessary to live a full life. Ableism manifests for people with aphasia as stigma and discrimination based on their language ability. We assert that ableism contributes to decreased quality of life for people with aphasia and should be actively challenged and disrupted by clinicians and researchers in the field.\nMETHOD: We applied the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework (HSDF) to outline how stigma and discrimination are perpetuated against people with aphasia on the basis of language ability and their downstream health and social consequences. We presented this framework at the Clinical Aphasiology Conference in 2023 and share themes and challenges that arose from this discussion and from our ongoing learning.\nDISCUSSION: Applying the HSDF to aphasia outlined potential sequelae of ableism. We identified preliminary foci of future initiatives aimed at challenging ableist beliefs and practices and means to monitor the effectiveness of such interventions. Furthermore, we draw attention to the seeming tension between anti-ableist practices and traditional language rehabilitation goals. We assert that this tension may be a catalyst for fruitful discourse on how clinicians and researchers can resist ableism while honoring the lived experiences of people with aphasia and their goals for language rehabilitation. These discussions may be facilitated by existing models in disability studies (e.g., the political/relational model).\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers are well positioned to challenge ableism and minimize the resultant health and social impacts for people living with aphasia. Anti-ableist practices are not antithetical to aphasia rehabilitation and can be thoughtfully integrated into rehabilitation practices and discourse.\nPMID:\n38901004\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00456",

However, a significant challenge in our field is the lack of accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of this research. Such insufficiencies limit the generalizability and impact of study findings, particularly intervention research, as it becomes difficult to replicate and use the interventions in both clinical practice and research. In this tutorial, we highlight one particularly useful tool, the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR; Hoffmann et al., 2014) checklist, which researchers can follow to improve reproducibility practices in SLHS.\nCONCLUSIONS: We provide an overview and guide on using the TIDieR checklist with a practical example of its implementation. Additionally, we discuss the potential benefits of increased transparency and reproducibility for SLHS, including improved clinical outcomes and increased confidence in the effectiveness of interventions. We also provide specific recommendations for scientists, journal reviewers, editors, and editorial boards as they seek to adopt, implement, and encourage using the TIDieR checklist.\nPMID:\n38889209\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00389",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Prior studies have shown that bilingual children who do not stutter (CWNS) exhibit a high number of disfluencies in both languages, increasing the risk of misidentification by speech-language pathologists as children who stutter (CWS). Conversely, there is a risk of misidentifying CWS with a relatively low incidence of disfluencies as CWNS. This study aims to explore the qualitative and quantitative distinctions in speech disfluency profiles between CWNS and CWS. The assessment covers both the dominant and nondominant language to examine the impact of language dominance on disfluency patterns.\nMETHOD: A total of 92 Lebanese bilinguals (70 CWNS and 22 CWS) from 4;06 to 7;06 (years;months) were included. Language dominance was determined based on parental assessments. Spontaneous and narrative speech samples were collected for each child in both languages and all stuttering-like disfluencies (SLD) and other disfluencies (OD) were coded.\nRESULTS: On average, CWNS showed a significantly lower percentage of total SLD, weighted SLD, SLD subtypes, and iterations compared to CWS. However, the number of disfluencies of CWNS exceeded monolingual clinical standards. Language dominance did not impact SLD and OD percentages, but some differences for SLD subtypes emerged. Binary logistic regression analyses showed that repetitions and dysrhythmic phonations are good predictors for correct CWS or CWNS classification, in contrast to OD. A combination of predictors from both languages led to better classification than using predictors from either language alone.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that speech disfluency percentages in bilingual CWNS typically surpass monolingual standards and can be at par with those of CWS. However, through careful consideration of disfluency characteristics, ideally in both languages, an accurate differential diagnosis of stuttering in bilingual children can be achieved.\nPMID:\n38889203\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00311",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can enhance aphasia recovery. Most studies have used inhibitory stimulation targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus. However, the motor cortex, observed to contribute to the prediction of aphasia recovery, is involved in word production and could be an appropriate target for rTMS. We aimed to observe behavioral changes in a picture naming task induced by inhibitory rTMS targeting the right motor cortex of the lips in people with poststroke aphasia.\nMETHOD: Using a single-case experimental design, we included three participants with chronic poststroke aphasia who had phonological deficits. Each participant performed a verbal picture naming task 3 times a week for 2, 3, or 4 weeks (pseudorandom across participants) to establish a baseline naming ability for each participant. These were not therapy sessions, and no feedback was provided. Then, each participant received the intervention, inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation targeting the right motor cortex of the lips, 3 times a week for 2 weeks. Naming testing continued 3 times a week, for these latter 2 weeks. No therapy was performed at any time during the study.\nRESULTS: Visual analysis of the graphs showed a positive effect of rTMS for P2 and P3 on picture naming accuracy and a tendency toward improvement for P1. Statistical analysis showed an improvement after rTMS for P1 (τ = 0.544,\np = .\n013,\nSE\nTau\n= 0.288) and P2 (τ = 0.708,\np = .\n001,\nSE\nTau\n= 0.235). For P3, even if the intervention allowed some improvement, this was statistically nonsignificant due to a learning effect during the baseline naming testing, which lasted the longest, 4 weeks. Regarding specific language features, phonological errors significantly decreased in all patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The motor cortex of the lips could be an appropriate target for rTMS to improve naming in people with poststroke aphasia suffering from a phonological deficit. This suggests the possibility to individualize the target for rTMS, according to the patient's linguistic impairment.\nPMID:\n38875479\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00215",

Additionally, none have manipulated dose frequency or reported on the use of music as a medium through which language and sign can be learned.\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to (a) examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online language through music intervention for young children (1-3;6 years) with Down syndrome and (b) compare effectiveness at two intervention dose frequencies.\nMETHOD: The study was carried out in two phases using a mixed-methods design.\nPhase 1:\nQualitative data were gathered from parents to examine feasibility when implementing a video-based language intervention.\nPhase 2:\nSeventy-six families participated in an online language intervention at home. Effectiveness was examined comparing two groups, randomly assigned to a high and low dose frequency. The Down Syndrome Education (DSE) checklists (combined) were the primary outcome measure. Process data were gathered to determine intervention acceptability in practice and to identify factors that would improve successful future implementation. Acceptability data were analyzed with reference to the theoretical framework of acceptability (Version 2).\nRESULTS: Forty-three parents completed the Phase 1 scoping questionnaire, five of whom took part in focus groups. Once weekly morning sessions were indicated as the preferred scheduling choice. Phase 2 quantitative data were analyzed using beta regression adjusted for baseline scores and indicated no additional benefit to receiving the higher dose. However, exploratory interaction models suggested that the efficacy of the high-dose intervention was higher (than low-dose intervention) in participants with higher baseline DSE performance. Parents perceived the intervention to be effective and positive for the family.\nCONCLUSION: The results add to our knowledge of real-world effective online interventions and suggest that a critical minimum language level is required for children with Down syndrome to benefit optimally from a higher intervention dose frequency.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25979704.\nPMID:\n38861452\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00375",

By describing their clinical profiles, we identify common barriers to functional communication in this population and provide recommendations for how speech-language pathologists (SLPs) might contribute to minimizing them.\nMETHOD: Four patients with bvFTD were selected from a cohort of patients with progressive communication impairments. Three of them returned for at least one follow-up visit. Case histories are presented along with the results of comprehensive speech and language, neuropsychological, and neurological testing.\nRESULTS: At the time of initial evaluation, patients were between the ages of 54 and 66 years and had been experiencing symptoms for 1.5-6 years. Consistent with their bvFTD diagnoses, all patients had prominent behavioral and personality changes that impacted communication. Patients 1 and 2 also had mild aphasia at enrollment, primarily characterized by anomia and loss of word meaning. Patients 3 and 4 both had apraxia of speech and moderate-to-severe aphasia at enrollment with prominent anomia and agrammatism. All four patients had impaired executive functioning and relative sparing of visuospatial skills; episodic memory was also impaired for Patients 2 and 4. Even though functional communication was progressively limited for all patients, none of them received regular support from an SLP.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case series adds to a scant, but growing, literature demonstrating that patients with bvFTD have communication impairments. SLPs are uniquely positioned to identify barriers to functional communication and to provide tailored strategy training to the patients and their care partners over the course of their disease. Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of treatment in this population would be valuable.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25933762.\nPMID:\n38843453\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-24-00013",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Prior work has identified weaknesses in commonly used indices of lexical diversity in spoken language samples, such as type-token ratio (TTR) due to sample size and elicitation variation, we explored whether TTR and other diversity measures, such as number of different words/100 (NDW), vocabulary diversity (VocD), and the moving average TTR would be more sensitive to child age and clinical status (typically developing [TD] or developmental language disorder [DLD]) if samples were obtained from standardized prompts.\nMETHOD: We utilized archival data from the norming samples of the Test of Narrative Language and the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument. We examined lexical diversity and other linguistic properties of the samples, from a total of 1,048 children, ages 4-11 years; 798 of these were considered TD, whereas 250 were categorized as having a language learning disorder.\nRESULTS: TTR was the least sensitive to child age or diagnostic group, with good potential to misidentify children with DLD as TD and TD children as having DLD. Growth slopes of NDW were shallow and not very sensitive to diagnostic grouping. The strongest performing measure was VocD. Mean length of utterance, TNW, and verbs/utterance did show both good growth trajectories and ability to distinguish between clinical and typical samples.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study, the largest and best controlled to date, re-affirms that TTR should not be used in clinical decision making with children. A second popular measure, NDW, is not measurably stronger in terms of its psychometric properties. Because the most sensitive measure of lexical diversity, VocD, is unlikely to gain popularity because of reliance on computer-assisted analysis, we suggest alternatives for the appraisal of children's expressive vocabulary skill.\nPMID:\n38838249\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00457",

In particular, couples considered whether discussing their relationship roles and responsibilities was important and relevant to the changes they desire. Preliminary quasi-experimental data regarding perceived communication confidence and the marriage relationship were also obtained.\nMETHOD: Three couples participated in RC-CPT across two sessions. Surveys were used to measure communication confidence and the marital relationship before and after participation in RC-CPT. The quantitative findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Couples also participated in a semistructured interview about the acceptability of RC-CPT during a third session. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using reflexive codebook analysis.\nRESULTS: Quantitative data indicated that participants generally maintained or improved self-rated accessibility, responsiveness, engagement, conflict resolution, and communication within their marriage after participating in RC-CPT. Additionally, individuals with aphasia demonstrated enhanced communication confidence scores. Qualitative analysis revealed three themes: (a) Impact on Communication, (b) Impact on Relationship, and (c) Impact on Psychosocial Well-Being. Feedback from participants regarding future development was also included.\nCONCLUSIONS: The convergence of quantitative and qualitative data supports the conclusion that couples experienced positive changes in their communication, relationship, and psychosocial well-being during the intervention, suggesting that RC-CPT has the potential to positively impact both communicative and psychosocial effects of aphasia on couples. Moreover, this study highlights the promise of RC-CPT as a relationship-centered counseling tool, warranting further exploratory and experimental research.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25937383.\nPMID:\n38838246\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00348",

Using mixed methods, this study aimed to understand literacy experiences described by individuals with aphasia and explore how their perspectives are related to test performance and other demographic factors.\nMETHOD: Twenty-one stroke survivors with aphasia completed reading and writing testing and shared their perspectives through a close-ended survey and an open-ended interview about literacy abilities and experiences. Quantitative methods were used to compare pre- and poststroke self-ratings and explore associations between self-ratings and demographic factors. Qualitative methods were used to identify themes in the interviews. The data sets were merged to derive mixed-methods results for a more in-depth view of participants' perspectives.\nRESULTS: Significant decreases in perceived literacy abilities were found; however, there were no differences in literacy importance or enjoyment pre- to poststroke. Reading and writing test scores were correlated with self-rated abilities but not with importance, enjoyment, or frequency of reading and writing. The thematic analysis process identified four main themes:\nFeelings about literacy\n,\nLiteracy challenges\n,\nLiteracy supports\n, and\nLiteracy goals\n.\nCONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that individuals with aphasia highly value reading and writing and are heavily invested, despite recognized challenges, in using and improving these skills. Therefore, assessments and treatments addressing literacy in aphasia are critical, and individuals with aphasia should be invited to share their literacy experiences and goals, allowing for more person-centered clinical resources to be collaboratively constructed.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25893049.\nPMID:\n38820595\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00360",

Each speaker was paired with a typical interlocutor over videoconferencing software. The speakers produced the vowels /i, ɪ, ɛ, æ/ in /h/-vowel-/d/ words. For the solo tasks, speakers read the stimuli aloud in both their habitual and clear speaking styles. For the interactive task, speakers produced a target stimulus for their interlocutor to select among the four possibilities. We measured the duration difference between long and short vowels, as well as the F1/F2 Euclidean distance between adjacent vowels, and also determined how well the vowels could be classified based on their acoustic characteristics.\nRESULTS: Temporal contrast between long and short vowels was higher in the interactive task than in both solo tasks. Spectral distance between adjacent vowel pairs was also higher for some pairs in the interactive task than the habitual speech task. Finally, vowel classification accuracy was highest in the interactive task.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found evidence that individuals with dysarthria produced vowels with greater acoustic contrast in structured interactions than they did in solo tasks. Furthermore, the speech adjustments they made to the vowel segments differed from those observed in solo speech.\nPMID:\n38809826\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00372",

We analyze the factors influencing this disparity and the effect of speech mode-specific training on ASR accuracy.\nMETHOD: Recordings of read and conversational speech from 27 individuals with various speech disorders were analyzed using both (a) one speaker-independent ASR system trained and optimized for typical speech and (b) multiple ASR models that were personalized to the speech of the participants with disordered speech. Word error rates were calculated for each speech model, read versus conversational, and subject. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the impact of speech mode and disorder severity on ASR accuracy. We investigated nine variables, classified as technical, linguistic, or speech impairment factors, for their potential influence on the performance gap.\nRESULTS: We found a significant performance gap between read and conversational speech in both personalized and unadapted ASR models. Speech impairment severity notably impacted recognition accuracy in unadapted models for both speech modes and in personalized models for read speech. Linguistic attributes of utterances were the most influential on accuracy, though atypical speech characteristics also played a role. Including conversational speech samples in model training notably improved recognition accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant performance gap in ASR accuracy between read and conversational speech for individuals with speech disorders. This gap was largely due to the linguistic complexity and unique characteristics of speech disorders in conversational speech. Training personalized ASR models using conversational speech significantly improved recognition accuracy, demonstrating the importance of domain-specific training and highlighting the need for further research into ASR systems capable of handling disordered conversational speech effectively.\nPMID:\n38963790\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00045",

In the current study, we addressed whether written syntax features differed by language (English and Spanish) and varied as a function of grade level, English learner status, and instructional program (dual or English immersion). We also examined whether Spanish and English syntax features were related cross-linguistically and related to writing quality within languages and whether these relations to writing quality were moderated by grade level, English learner status, and instructional program.\nMETHOD: We examined written syntax features of Spanish and English essays by simultaneous and emergent bilinguals in Grades 1, 2, and 3 in either Spanish-English dual immersion or English immersion instruction in the United States (\nN\n= 278). Essays were scored for quality and evaluated for mean length of T-units, number of verbs, number of noun agreement words, and number of subject agreement words accurately conjugated.\nRESULTS: Written syntax features significantly differed by language and varied as a function of grade level, English learner status, and instructional program. Grades 2 and 3 wrote longer utterances, more verbs, and greater noun agreement accuracy than Grade 1. Syntax features were related to writing quality within languages, but Spanish relations were weaker for English learners than non-English learners and for dual immersion students than English immersion students.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest written syntax features may be useful for evaluation of English-Spanish simultaneous and emergent bilinguals' writing.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25927366.\nPMID:\n38963732\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00270",

This myoarchitecture cannot, however, explain independent tongue body and blade movement nor accurately model the subtlety of observed lingual shapes. This study presents the case for a finer neuromuscular structure and functional description.\nMETHOD: Using the theoretical framework of the partitioning hypothesis, evidence for neuromuscular compartments of each of the lingual muscles was discerned by reviewing studies of lingual anatomy, hypoglossal nerve staining, hypoglossal motoneuron axon tracing, muscle fiber type distribution, and electromyography. Muscle fibers of the visible human female were manually traced to produce a three-dimensional atlas of muscular compartments. A kinematic study was undertaken to determine the degree of independent movement between different parts of the tongue. A simple biomechanical model was used to demonstrate how synergistic groups of compartments can control sectors of the tongue.\nRESULTS: Results indicated as many as 10 compartments of genioglossus, two each of superior and inferior longitudinal, eight of styloglossus, three of hyoglossus, and six each of transversus and verticalis, while palatoglossus may not have a significant role in tongue function. Kinematic analysis indicated independent control of five sectors of the tongue body, and biomechanical modeling demonstrated how this control may be achieved.\nCONCLUSION: Evidence is presented for a lingual structure based on neuromuscular compartments, which work together to position and shape sectors of the tongue and independently control tongue body and blade.\nPMID:\n38959159\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00125",

This corpus was tested on a large cohort of U.S. Service members in order to examine the effects of talker nativeness, listener nativeness, masker type, and hearing sensitivity on speech recognition performance in this population.\nMETHOD: A total of 1,939 U.S. Service members (ages 18-68 years) completed this closed-set listening task, including 430 women and 110 nonnative English speakers. Stimuli were produced by native and nonnative speakers of English and were presented in speech-shaped noise and multitalker babble. Keyword recognition accuracy and response times were analyzed.\nRESULTS: General(ized) linear mixed-effects regression models found that, on the whole, speech recognition performance was lower for listeners who identified as nonnative speakers of English and when listening to speech produced by nonnative speakers of English. Talker and listener effects were more pronounced when listening in a babble masker than in a speech-shaped noise masker. Response times varied as a function of recognition score, with longest response times found for intermediate levels of performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study found additive effects of talker and listener nonnativeness when listening to speech in background noise. These effects were present in both accuracy and response time measures. No multiplicative effects of talker and listener language background were found. There was little evidence of a negative interaction between talker nonnativeness and hearing impairment, suggesting that these factors may have redundant effects on speech recognition.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26060191.\nPMID:\n38950169\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00312",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This study aims at investigating the phonological development of the six guttural consonants of Jordanian Arabic, /χ/, /ʁ/, /ħ/, /ʕ/, /ʔ/, and /h/.\nMETHOD: An articulation test is designed to involve two tasks: picture naming and repetition. The test includes 54 words for picture naming and 18 words for repetition, representing all possible positions of the targeted guttural sounds. Samples are collected from 40 typically developing Ammani-Jordanian Arabic-speaking monolingual children, living in Amman, Jordan. Respondents are equally divided into eight age-related trajectories: 2-2;6, 2;6-3, 3-3;6, 3;6-4, 4-4;6, 4;6-5, 5-5;6, and 5;6-6 (years;months). No child with a history of hearing, speech, or vision disorders is included. The data are analyzed using\nproduction accuracy\n, where the three developmental trajectories of production (customary, acquisition, and mastery) are determined for each guttural, and\nerror analysis\n, addressed based on perceptual judgments, providing details of every mispronounced or deleted guttural.\nRESULTS: The results show that /χ/, /ħ/, /ʕ/, and /ʔ/ are acquired before the age of 6 years, while /ʁ/ and /h/ are still not acquired by this age. Respondents use relatively variant alternatives for the mispronounced cognates, including guttural, nonguttural sounds, and vowel substitution. The /ʁ/ is the guttural with the highest number of alternatives, while /ʔ/ gets the least. The analysis also reveals patterns of guttural deletion, with variations across different guttural sounds and positions. Despite errors/deviations made, respondents score accuracy percentages that gradually increase in correlation with age. The guttural /ʁ/ starts with the lowest accuracy percentages, while /ʔ/ and /ħ/ start with the highest.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings illuminate on the developmental trajectory of guttural acquisition and enrich our understanding of children's evolving perception and production abilities. They offer valuable insights into the patterns of guttural sound production in Jordanian Arabic-speaking children, laying the groundwork for further research and the development of targeted assessment and intervention strategies to support phonological development in this population.\nPMID:\n38941556\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00085",

We first examined the relation between lexical morphology and phonological processes in typically developing readers (Study 1,\nN\n= 66,\nM\nage\n= 8.39), followed by a more focal inquiry into lexical morphology processes in dyslexia (Study 2,\nN\n= 50,\nM\nage\n= 8.62).\nRESULTS: Typical readers exhibited stronger engagement of language neurocircuitry during the morphology task relative to the phonology task, suggesting that morphological analyses involve synthesizing multiple components of sublexical processing. This effect was stronger for more analytically complex derivational affixes (\nlike + ly\n) than more semantically transparent free base morphemes (\nsnow + man\n). In contrast, children with dyslexia exhibited stronger activation during the free base condition relative to derivational affix condition. Taken together, the findings suggest that although children with dyslexia may struggle with derivational morphology, they may also use free base morphemes' semantic information to boost word recognition.\nCONCLUSION: This study informs literacy theories by identifying an interaction between reading ability, word structure, and how the developing brain learns to recognize words in speech and print.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25944949.\nPMID:\n38924392\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00293",

In this study, we developed a technique to holistically examine neural activity differences in speaking and silent reading conditions across the entire cortical surface. This approach allows us to test the hypothesis that AWS will exhibit lower separability of the speech motor planning condition.\nMETHOD: We used the silent reading condition as a control condition to isolate speech motor planning activity. We classified EEG signals from AWS and ANS individuals into speaking and silent reading categories using kernel support vector machines. We used relative complexities of the learned classifiers to compare speech motor planning discernibility for both classes.\nRESULTS: AWS group classifiers require a more complex decision boundary to separate speech motor planning and silent reading classes.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the EEG signals associated with speech motor planning are less discernible in AWS, which may result from altered neuronal dynamics in AWS. Our results support the hypothesis that AWS exhibit lower inherent separability of the silent reading and speech motor planning conditions. Further investigation may identify and compare the features leveraged for speech motor classification in AWS and ANS. These observations may have clinical value for developing novel speech therapies or assistive devices for AWS.\nPMID:\n38924389\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00635",

However, previous research utilizing RT in the context of language has largely overlooked the intra-individual variability (IIV) of RTs, which could hold significant information about the processes underlying language acquisition.\nMETHOD: We explored the association between language abilities and RT variability in visuomotor tasks using two data sets from previously published studies. The participants were 7- to 10-year-old children (\nn\n= 77).\nRESULTS: Our results suggest that increased variability in RTs is associated with weaker language abilities. Specifically, this within-participant variability in visuomotor RTs, especially the proportion of unusually slow responses, predicted language abilities better than mean RTs, a factor often linked to language skills in past research.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we introduce the IIV hypothesis in explaining individual differences in language development. According to our hypothesis, inconsistency in the timing of cognitive processes, reflected by increased IIV in RTs, degrades learning different aspects of language, and results in individual differences in language abilities. Future studies should further examine the relationship between IIV and language abilities, and test the extent to which the possible relationship is causal.\nPMID:\n38913843\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00527",

The study aims to test the validity of the Palestinian Arabic Communicative Development Inventory (PA-CDI) as well as generate growth curves for lexical and morphosyntactic development, examine the order of emergence of both lexical and morphosyntactic categories, and explore the contribution of demographic and developmental factors to language development.\nMETHOD: Data were collected from 1,399 parents of PA children aged 18-36 months using an online PA-CDI.\nRESULTS: The results show that as age increased, so did lexical and morphosyntactic production, along with considerable variability across individuals. While lexical development in PA resembles the order observed in other languages with nouns preceding verbs and adjectives, morphosyntactic development indicates early emergence of verbal inflectional morphology prior to noun pluralization or negation. Age of word combination and health problems are predictive of lexical and morphosyntactic development, and so are parental concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the potential of the PA-CDI as an assessment tool for lexical and morphosyntactic development among PA-speaking children in Israel. Our developmental growth curves may also be used to identify children at risk for developmental language disorder, particularly those falling below the 10th percentile, thus allowing for early identification and early intervention. The use of background variables, specifically parental concerns, health issues, and word combinations, along with the PA-CDI, could potentially enhance the precision of language delay assessment.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26026777.\nPMID:\n38901010\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00606",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This study evaluated the psychometric functioning of a new criterion-referenced assessment of adolescent social communication, the Transition Pragmatics Interview (TPI), based on the synthesis model of pragmatics. Two ways of interpreting item difficulty were explored: (a) as a function of the synthesis model elements of social communication ability that items were designed to assess, and (b) as a function of the developmental level required for a successful response based on an adapted situational-discourse-semantics (SDS) model (Norris & Hoffman, 1993).\nMETHOD: Thirty-seven participants aged 14-22 years completed the TPI. Responses were analyzed using Rasch analysis to evaluate the functioning of the scale and to determine item difficulty. Items were coded for the SDS developmental level required for an adequate response. The mean Rasch item difficulty for items at each SDS developmental level was analyzed for the five adapted SDS domains.\nRESULTS: Consistent with the first approach for interpreting item difficulty, TPI items varied in difficulty as a function of the element of social communication they were designed to assess (\np\n< .001). Interpreting item difficulty based on the adapted SDS model was not supported: Items requiring higher SDS developmental levels were not more difficult than those requiring less (\np\n= .55).\nCONCLUSIONS: The TPI responses fit the Rasch model, supporting the TPI as a unidimensional measure and supporting the use of all items together to compute a single number that summarizes the level of social communication for each examinee. The item ordering from least to most difficult was consistent with prior findings on adolescent social communication development.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26018545.\nPMID:\n38896882\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00709",

Children completed assessments of oral paragraph reading and word decoding using a vowelized script. They also completed three spoken assessments of Colloquial Arabic, which include sentence comprehension, sentence completion, and pragmatic knowledge, as well as a test of phonological awareness. We used path analysis to investigate the contributions of each of the spoken language indicators, decoding, and phonological awareness to reading comprehension (RC) in single and multiple serial mediator models.\nRESULTS: We found that spoken language (i.e., sentence comprehension, sentence completion, and pragmatic knowledge) and word decoding uniquely contributed to RC. Moreover, word decoding mediated the association between spoken language and RC. The path from spoken language to phonological awareness, then to word decoding, and finally to RC was inconclusive.\nCONCLUSIONS: While most studies on literacy acquisition in the context of Arabic diglossia focus on the linguistic distance between the colloquial (spoken) and the standard (written) language varieties, our results highlight the important contribution of spoken language skills to reading skills in Arabic despite this linguistic gap. The important implication of these findings is that spoken language interventions aimed at boosting children's narrative language skills in their home language (Colloquial Arabic) are an important tool for building a foundation for literacy in diglossia contexts.\nPMID:\n38889224\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00522",

However, poor understanding of the clinical phenotype during childhood has hindered the development of clinical practice guidelines for screening and intervention. Given that social communication difficulties have been widely documented in adults with the FXpm and are linked with reduced psychosocial functioning, the present study aimed to characterize the communication profile of the FXpm during early childhood.\nMETHOD: Eighteen children with the FXpm who were identified through cascade testing (89%) or screening at birth (11%) were compared to 21 matched typically developing children, aged 2-4 years. Participants completed standardized assessments of language (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) and adaptive communication (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II). Social communication was rated from seminaturalistic interaction samples using the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change.\nRESULTS: Children with the FXpm showed delayed social communication development, with the magnitude of group differences highlighting social communication as a feature that distinguishes children with the FXpm from their peers (\np =\n.046, η\np\n2\n= .12). The groups did not differ on the standardized language and adaptive communication measures (\np\ns > .297, η\np\n2\ns < .03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Early screening and treatment of social communication delays may be key to optimizing outcomes for children with the FXpm.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Caregivers share critical insight during their child's stuttering evaluation; yet, there have been no empirical studies evaluating whether caregivers provide similar accounts of their 3- to 6-year-old child's communication attitude compared to their child's self-report. This study examined caregiver- and child-reported communication attitude and assessed potential moderators of more comparable caregiver and child ratings (i.e., caregiver confidence, caregiver-child conflict, observer-rated stuttering severity).\nMETHOD: One hundred thirteen children who stutter ages 3 through 6 years and a primary caregiver were recruited from clinical settings across the United States. Children completed the Communication Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten Children Who Stutter (KiddyCAT) and three speaking samples, which were recorded to assess observer-rated stuttering severity using the Stuttering Severity Instrument-Fourth Edition. Caregivers predicted their child's communication attitude (C-KiddyCAT) and provided a confidence rating for their prediction. Caregivers also rated caregiver-child conflict using the Child-Parent Relationship Scale-Short Form (CPRS-SF). Multiple regression was used to (a) evaluate whether caregiver C-KiddyCAT scores predicted child KiddyCAT scores and (b) assess potential moderators of the relationship between C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores.\nRESULTS: Caregiver ratings of their child's communication attitude (C-KiddyCAT) predicted child communication attitude ratings (KiddyCAT). A significant interaction between caregiver-child conflict (CPRS-SF) and caregiver ratings of their child's communication attitude (C-KiddyCAT) suggested caregiver-child conflict changed the underlying relationship between C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores, such that low conflict resulted in more similar C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores. Neither caregiver confidence nor observer-rated stuttering severity influenced the relationship between C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although many caregivers predicted communication attitude ratings that closely aligned with their child's report, some caregiver-child dyads provided divergent ratings. Clinicians should interpret caregiver predictions of their child's communication attitude within the context of their full evaluation and the caregiver-child relationship. Assessing both self-reported communication attitude and caregiver predictions of their child's communication attitude provides a meaningful starting point to counseling caregivers about cognitive components of stuttering for preschool- and kindergarten-age children who stutter.\nPMID:\n38889195\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00662",

The purpose was to determine whether CLAN's FLUCALC command could produce efficient, objective outcome measures for salient aspects of fluency in aphasia.\nMETHOD: The FLUCALC command was used on CHAT transcripts of Cinderella stories from people with aphasia (PWA;\nn\n= 281) and controls (\nn\n= 257) in the AphasiaBank database.\nRESULTS: PWA produced significantly fewer total words, fewer words per minute, more pausing, more repetitions, more revisions, and more phonological fragments than controls, with only one exception: The Wernicke's group was similar to the control group in percentage of filled pauses. Individuals with Broca's aphasia had significantly longer inter-utterance pauses and fewer total words than all other aphasia groups. Both the Broca's and conduction aphasia groups had higher percentages of phrase repetitions than the NABW (NotAphasicByWAB) group. The conduction aphasia group also had a higher percentage of phrase revisions than the NABW and the anomic aphasia groups. Principal components analysis revealed two principal components that accounted for around 60% of the variance and related to quantity of output, rate of speech, and quality of output. The Gaussian mixture models showed that the participants clustered in three groups, which corresponded predominantly to the controls, the nonfluent aphasia group, and the remaining aphasia groups (all classically fluent aphasia types).\nCONCLUSIONS: FLUCALC is an efficient way to measure objective fluency behaviors in language samples in aphasia.

Risk factors that predicted PNIHL in the analyzed cohort were as follows: syndromes associated with hearing loss, craniofacial anomalies, perinatal infections, and family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. Severe asphyxia did not predict PNIHL but yielded some cases of significant bilateral hearing loss. Hearing loss in children with a history of prolonged ventilation was mild and/or unilateral in nature (except in cases where the hearing loss was due to an unrelated etiology). There were no cases of PNIHL in children with hyperbilirubinemia or neonatal bacterial meningitis. For the risk factors that predicted PNIHL, nearly all hearing losses were detected by 1 year of age, except for children with family history where one quarter of hearing losses had a later onset.\nCONCLUSIONS: The four risk factors recommended for efficient postnatal identification of hearing loss are as follows: syndromes associated with hearing loss, craniofacial anomalies, perinatal infection, and family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. Hearing surveillance through to 1 year old is sufficient except for children with a family history, where a second phase assessment is indicated. Alternative targeted surveillance protocols and models of care are required to minimize loss to follow-up.\nPMID:\n38875481\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00499",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of singing as an intervention for aging voice.\nMETHOD: Quantitative studies of interventions for older adults with any medical condition that involves singing as training were reviewed, measured by respiration, phonation, and posture, which are the physical functions related to the aging voice. English and Chinese studies published until April 2024 were searched using 31 electronic databases, and seven studies were included. The included articles were assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations rubric.\nRESULTS: Seven studies were included. These studies reported outcome measures that were related to respiratory functions only. For the intervention effect, statistically significant improvements were observed in five of the included studies, among which three studies had large effect sizes. The overall level of evidence of the included studies was not high, with three studies having moderate levels and the rest having lower levels. The intervention activities included trainings other than singing. These non-singing training items may have caused co-intervention bias in the study results.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that singing as an intervention for older adults with respiratory and cognitive problems could improve respiration and respiratory-phonatory control. However, none of the included studies covers the other two of the physical functions related to aging voice (phonatory and postural functions). The overall level of evidence of the included studies was not high either. There is a need for more research evidence in singing-based intervention specifically for patient with aging voice.\nPMID:\n38875480\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00641",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The vocal fold tissues undergo nearly continuous and repeated cycles of injury and repair throughout the course of an individual's lifetime. It is well established that certain individuals are at greater risk of lesion development based on personality and behavioral classification. However, these characteristics alone do not wholly predict or explain lesion development or severity. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of mechanotransduction proteins and their potential relevance to tissue homeostasis in the vocal folds.\nMETHOD: A review of literature surrounding mechanotransduction and tissue homeostasis as it relates to the vocal folds was conducted. Review of the literature included searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, and other various online peer-reviewed sources. Search terms pertained to mechanosensation, mechanotransduction, mechanically activated channels, mechanical cellular regulation, and other associated concepts and terms. Additional literature was identified through the reference lists of identified papers. Findings of this literature review were then applied to known physiology and pathophysiology of the vocal folds in order to speculate on the contribution of mechanically mediated mechanisms within the vocal fold.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Because the vocal folds are such mechanically active structures, withstanding nearly constant external forces, there is strong support for the idea that mechanically sensitive molecular pathways within the vocal fold tissue play a major role in tissue homeostasis in the presence of these considerable forces. As such, mechanotransduction within the vocal fold should be considered and targeted in future biological studies of vocal fold physiology.\nPMID:\n38865255\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00718",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Although different factors and voice measures have been associated with phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH), it is unclear what percentage of individuals with PVH exhibit such differences during their daily lives. This study used a machine learning approach to quantify the consistency with which PVH manifests according to ambulatory voice measures. Analyses included acoustic parameters of phonation as well as temporal aspects of phonation and rest, with the goal of determining optimally consistent signatures of PVH.\nMETHOD: Ambulatory neck-surface acceleration signals were recorded over 1 week from 116 female participants diagnosed with PVH and age-, sex-, and occupation-matched vocally healthy controls. The consistency of the manifestation of PVH was defined as the percentage of participants in each group that exhibited an atypical signature based on a target voice measure. Evaluation of each machine learning model used nested 10-fold cross-validation to improve the generalizability of findings. In Experiment 1, we trained separate logistic regression models based on the distributional characteristics of 14 voice measures and durations of voicing and resting segments. In Experiments 2 and 3, features of voicing and resting duration augmented the existing distributional characteristics to examine whether more consistent signatures would result.\nRESULTS: Experiment 1 showed that the difference in the magnitude of the first two harmonics (H1-H2) exhibited the most consistent signature (69.4% of participants with PVH and 20.4% of controls had an atypical H1-H2 signature), followed by spectral tilt over eight harmonics (73.6% participants with PVH and 32.1% of controls had an atypical spectral tilt signature) and estimated sound pressure level (SPL; 66.9% participants with PVH and 27.6% of controls had an atypical SPL signature). Additionally, 77.6% of participants with PVH had atypical resting duration, with 68.9% exhibiting atypical voicing duration. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that augmenting the best-performing voice measures with univariate features of voicing or resting durations yielded only incremental improvement in the classifier's performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Females with PVH were more likely to use more abrupt vocal fold closure (lower H1-H2), phonate louder (higher SPL), and take shorter vocal rests. They were also less likely to use higher fundamental frequency during their daily activities. The difference in the voicing duration signature between participants with PVH and controls had a large effect size, providing strong empirical evidence regarding the role of voice use in the development of PVH.\nPMID:\n38861454\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00515",

In this research note, we report feasibility and preliminary data from a new conversation memory study protocol.\nMETHOD: Participants in this feasibility study were 10 pairs, each including an adult with chronic, moderate-to-severe TBI and their chosen familiar conversation partner. The experiment began with a naturalistic conversation between participants with TBI and their conversation partners. After a filled delay, participants next completed verbal recall for the conversation, which we transcribed and coded for their accuracy relative to the original conversation. Participants also read chosen statements from their original conversation and predicted what each partner would remember in a week. One week later, participants completed a posttest about who said each of the chosen statements, allowing direct comparison to their predictions.\nRESULTS: We successfully collected conversation memory data from all 10 pairs, suggesting that this protocol is feasible for future study. In this preliminary sample, people with TBI and their conversation partners did not differ in the accuracy of their recall for the conversation about 20 min after it occurred. When asked to predict their partner's delayed memory, conversation partners were less accurate than participants with TBI because they underestimated how much their partners with TBI would remember.\nCONCLUSION: Measuring memory for conversation in TBI is feasible and may advance the characterization of cognitive-communication impairment in TBI, and its heterogeneity, in everyday contexts.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25927513.\nPMID:\n38861453\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00420",

MV was defined as producing fewer than 20 spontaneous, unique, and socially communicative words. Autism symptom severity (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition) and nonverbal cognitive skills (Leiter-R Brief IQ) were assessed at entry. A natural language sample (NLS), a 20-min examiner-child interaction with specified toys, was collected at entry (Week 1) and exit (Week 18) from JASPER + EMT intervention. The NLS was coded for gestures (deictic, conventional, and representational) and gesture-speech combinations (reinforcing, disambiguating, supplementary, other) at entry and spoken language outcomes: speech quantity (rate of speech utterances) and speech quality (number of different words [NDW] and mean length of utterance in words [MLUw]) at exit using European Distributed Corpora Project Linguistic Annotator and Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts.\nRESULTS: Controlling for nonverbal IQ and autism symptom severity at entry, rate of gesture-speech combinations (but not gestures alone) at entry was a significant predictor of rate of speech utterances and MLUw at exit. The rate of supplementary gesture-speech combinations, in particular, significantly predicted rate of speech utterances and NDW at exit.\nCONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical importance of gestural communication, particularly gesture-speech (supplementary) combinations in supporting spoken language development in MV autistic children.\nPMID:\n38861424\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00433",

Narratives were elicited in SL/Hebrew using the wordless picture book,\nFrog, Where Are You?\nNarratives were transcribed and coded for frequency of ISTs and classified as perceptual, linguistic, motivational, linguistic, emotional, or physical. ISTs were also examined in terms of their role in microstructure (tokens and types) and macrostructure (Character, Setting, Initiating Event, Internal Response, Plan, Attempt, and Consequence) categories.\nRESULTS: In terms of microstructure, bilingual children with DLD produced fewer word types and tokens in general and fewer perceptual ISTs than bilingual TLD peers. In terms of macrostructure, children with DLD used six out of the seven story grammar elements in their narratives less than bilinguals with TLD. For ISTs and macrostructure, bilinguals with DLD produced fewer linguistic ISTs in Attempts than their peers with TLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bilingual children with DLD have difficulties in producing ISTs, and this difficulty is shown to be related to both microstructure and macrostructure abilities. Suggestions for clinical intervention are offered to assist children with DLD in producing narratives that involve mental state language related to characters' feelings, intentions, and goals.\nPMID:\n38913847\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00170",

Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and promise of a writing intervention for fourth- and fifth-grade students with LLD (WILLD: writing in students with LLD). The intervention components included word-, sentence-, and discourse-level writing processes and instructional practices using self-regulation strategies.\nMETHOD: Participants for this study were 15 students with LLD, recruited from three different schools. Students' writing was assessed using a sentence probe task and obtaining an informative paragraph writing sample as a measure of proximal writing outcomes. Trained speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and special educators delivered the intervention in a small-group format over 12 weeks. Using a within-group pre-post design, we examined changes in writing outcomes before and after the intervention.\nRESULTS: Results indicated that the intervention helped students improve their informative writing skills; students' writing quality showed a statistically significant increase, and grammatical errors showed a significant decrease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this pilot effort indicates that WILLD was feasible and appears to show promise for improving writing outcomes for fourth- and fifth-grade students with LLD when delivered by SLPs and special educators in a small-group format.

Treatment was carried out over 12 sessions with approximately two sessions per week. Maintenance sessions were conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks postintervention. Participants were explicitly taught story grammar elements, causal and temporal connections, and modifiers within story retells and personal narratives. Dependent variables were story grammar, grammatical complexity, modifiers and listening comprehension within story retells, and story grammar and grammatical complexity within personal narratives. Outcome measures were assessed at the end of every baseline, intervention, and maintenance session using the Narrative Language Measures-Listening (NLM-L).\nRESULTS: Visual analyses for outcome measures suggested slight increases in scores on the NLM-L during intervention accompanied by marked variability. Within-case analyses of story retell performance suggested an intervention effect on story grammar for two participants and on grammatical complexity and modifier use for one participant. For personal narratives, within-case analyses of personal narrative performance suggested an intervention effect on story grammar for one participant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall,\nStory Champs\ndemonstrated efficacy for improving story grammar use in story retells for three out of four participants.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: We investigated the effectiveness of a highly individualized morphosyntactic intervention using the SHAPE CODING™ system delivered at different dosages.\nMETHOD: Eight children with developmental language disorder aged 8;0-10;10 (years;months) received 10 hr of explicit individualized intervention for morphosyntax delivered in 30-min individual sessions once per week for 20 weeks. Following at least four baseline probe tests, two grammatical targets per session received explicit instruction until they reached criterion (90%), when the next target was introduced. To control for session length and teaching episode density, either both targets received 20 teaching episodes per session or one target received 10 teaching episodes and the other 30. Maintenance testing of completed targets was also carried out.\nRESULTS: Scores on probe tests post-intervention were significantly higher than during the baseline phase (\nd\n= 1.6) with no change during the baseline or maintenance phases. However, progress during the intervention phase was highly significant. One participant showed significantly faster progress with intervention, while one (with the lowest attention score) made little progress. When considering progress relative to cumulative intervention sessions, progress was faster with 30 teaching episodes per session and slower with 10. However, when cumulative teaching episodes were used as the predictor, all three within-session dosages showed very similar rates of progress, with the odds of a correct response increasing by 3.9% for each teaching episode. The targets that were achieved required an average of 40-60 teaching episodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the exception of one participant, the individualized intervention was highly effective and efficient. Thus, the individualized target identification process and intervention method merit further research in a larger group of children. The cumulative number of teaching episodes per target provided across sessions appeared to be key. Thus, clinicians should aim for high teaching episode rates, particularly if the number of sessions is constrained. Otherwise, intervention scheduling can be flexible.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25996168.\nPMID:\n38896880\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00098",

We (a) described preschoolers' performance on the CELFP-2 Core Language Index (CLI) and its subtests with consideration of degree of dialect variation (DVAR) observed, (b) investigated how the application of dialect-sensitive scoring modifications to the expressive morphology and syntax Word Structure (WS) subtest affected CELFP-2 CLI scores, and (c) evaluated the screening classification agreement rates between the DELV-ST and the CELFP-2 CLI.\nMETHOD: African American preschoolers (\nN\n= 284) completed the CELFP-2 CLI subtests (i.e., Sentence Structure, WS, Expressive Vocabulary) and the DELV-ST. Density of spoken dialect use was estimated with the DELV-ST Part I Language Variation Status, and percentage of DVAR was calculated. The CELFP-2 WS subtest was scored with and without dialect-sensitive scoring modifications.\nRESULTS: Planned comparisons of CELFP-2 CLI performance indicated statistically significant differences in performance based on DELV-ST-determined degree of language variation groupings. Scoring modifications applied to the WS subtest increased subtest scaled scores and CLI composite standard scores. However, preschoolers who demonstrated strong variation from GAE continued to demonstrate significantly lower performance than preschoolers who demonstrated little to no language variation. Affected-status agreement rates between assessments (modified and unmodified CELFP-2 CLI scores and DELV-ST Part II Diagnostic Risk Status) were extremely low.\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of dialect-specific scoring modifications to standardized, norm-referenced assessments of language must be simultaneously viewed through the lenses of equity, practicality, and psychometry. The results of our multistage study reiterate the need for reliable methods of identifying risk for developmental language disorder within children who speak American English dialects other than GAE.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26017978.\nPMID:\n38889198\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00134",

Growth curve models captured within- and between-individual change in article accuracy from the beginning of preschool to the end of first grade.\nRESULTS: As a group, DLLs did not exhibit significant positive or negative growth in Spanish article accuracy over time. On average, article accuracy remained stable at 76% from preschool throughout first grade. Participants exhibited significant variability in article accuracy that was partly explained by changes in Spanish proficiency. Spanish article accuracy was lower for DLLs with lower Spanish proficiency indexed by measures from the Spanish language samples, while English proficiency indexed by the English language samples did not affect Spanish article accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that expectations for Spanish grammatical performance in DLLs need to be adjusted to account for the possible impact of not receiving Spanish support in English immersion school settings. DLLs in these instructional programs do not exhibit article accuracy at a level expected for monolingual Spanish speakers. Significant individual differences in both individual status and growth rates of Spanish article accuracy highlight the broad variability in Spanish language skills of DLLs in the United States.\nPMID:\n38843435\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00202",

Reduced shared reading has been documented among families of caregiver(s) with language-based learning disabilities (LBLD). Yet, it remains unclear whether caregivers' history of language and reading difficulties is associated with caregiver self-efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine whether self-efficacy in language- and reading-related caregiver activities related to caregiver history of language and reading difficulties and shared reading practices.\nMETHOD: One hundred seventy-six caregivers of children aged 18-60 months completed a custom self-efficacy in language- and reading-related caregiver activities questionnaire, as well as demographic, history of language and reading difficulties (used both as a continuous measure and to dichotomize caregivers with and without LBLD history), and shared reading measures in a one-time survey.\nRESULTS: Caregivers with a history of LBLD reported an overall lower self-efficacy and a reduced amount of time reading with their children per week than caregivers without LBLD history. Examining caregiver history of language and reading difficulties continuously across the whole group, self-efficacy mediated the relationship between caregiver difficulties and shared reading practices, even when caregiver education was incorporated as an additional mediator in models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that self-efficacy and caregiver education mediate the relationship between caregiver history of language and reading difficulties and shared reading practices. Consideration of self-efficacy by clinicians and educators is warranted when promoting shared reading practices to caregivers of young children. There is a need for future research to examine relationships between self-efficacy and shared reading among caregivers with LBLD of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25901590.\nPMID:\n38820226\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00067",

These articles were subjected to rigorous evaluation for inclusion criteria, specifically focusing on their reporting of speech or auditory perception using psychoacoustic tasks. The selected studies exclusively examined school-age children, encompassing those between 5 and 18 years of age. Following rigorous evaluation, 10 articles meeting these criteria were selected for inclusion in the review.\nRESULTS: The analysis of included articles consistently shows that even slight hearing loss in school-age children significantly affects their speech and auditory perception. Notably, most of the included articles highlighted a common trend, demonstrating that perceptual deficits originating due to slight hearing loss in children are particularly observable under challenging experimental conditions and/or in cognitively demanding listening tasks. Recent evidence further underscores that the negative impacts of slight hearing loss in school-age children cannot be solely predicted by their pure-tone thresholds alone. However, there is limited evidence concerning the effect of slight hearing loss on the segregation of competing speech, which may be a better representation of listening in the classroom.\nCONCLUSION: This scoping review discusses the perceptual consequences of slight hearing loss in school-age children and provides insights into an array of methodological issues associated with studying perceptual skills in school-age children with slight hearing losses, offering guidance for future research endeavors.\nPMID:\n38787321\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00165",

It is therefore important for teachers to be able to assess children's language skills, especially if they are concerned about their learning. We report the development and standardization of a mobile app-LanguageScreen-that can be used by education professionals to assess children's language ability.\nMETHOD: The standardization sample included data from approximately 350,000 children aged 3;06 (years;months) to 8;11 who were screened for receptive and expressive language skills using LanguageScreen. Rasch scaling was used to select items of appropriate difficulty on a single unidimensional scale.\nRESULTS: LanguageScreen has excellent psychometric properties, including high reliability, good fit to the Rasch model, and minimal differential item functioning across key student groups. Girls outperformed boys, and children with English as an additional language scored less well compared to monolingual English speakers.\nCONCLUSIONS: LanguageScreen provides an easy-to-use, reliable, child-friendly means of identifying children with language difficulties.

Some transcribe these clauses as two separate utterances, whereas others conjoin them within a single utterance. As an inquiry into equitable practice, we examined rates of conjoined independent clauses produced by children and the impact of separating these clauses within utterances on measures of mean length of utterance (MLU) by a child's English dialect, clinical status, and age.\nMETHOD: The data were archival and included 246 language samples from children classified by their dialect (African American English or Southern White English) and clinical status (developmental language disorder [DLD] or typically developing [TD]), with those in the TD group further classified by their age (4 years [TD4] or 6 years [TD6]).\nRESULTS: Rates of conjoined independent clauses and the impact of these clauses on MLU varied by clinical status (DLD < TD) and age (TD4 < TD6), but not by dialect. Correlations between the rate of conjoined clauses, MLU, and language test scores were also similar across the two dialects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Transcription decisions regarding conjoined independent clauses within language samples lead to equitable measurement outcomes across dialects of English. Nevertheless, transcribing conjoined independent clauses as two separate utterances reduces one's ability to detect syntactic differences between children with and without DLD and document syntactic growth as children age.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25822675.\nPMID:\n38758707\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00180",

Participants included 273 English-speaking kindergarten through second-grade children with language impairment receiving business-as-usual therapy on the caseloads of 75 speech-language pathologists. Data were collected over an academic year, including weekly therapy logs, speech-language pathology questionnaires, and pre- and post-language measures.\nRESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed that children primarily experienced small-group therapy sessions (two to four children); however, there was considerable variability in group size. Hierarchical general linear modeling indicated that caseload size did not explain group size variability. However, the number of student cancellations was positively associated with receipt of large-group sessions. Notably, a significant negative association was found between receipt of large-group sessions (i.e., five to 10 children) and language outcomes. Children who received more than the average number of sessions in large groups (i.e., more than 5% of total sessions) experienced 0.18\nSD\nless language gain over the academic year compared to the mean (0.54\nSD\n). No other group size configurations (i.e., individual, small group, and extra large) yielded significant associations with language outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that young children receiving language-based therapy in large groups make substantially fewer language gains over an academic year. These results have considerable implications for educational policy and clinical practice, which are discussed through an implementation science frame.\nPMID:\n38748997\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00047",

Discourse elicitation and analysis provides the opportunity for such an evaluation to occur. In this article, our overall aim was to describe adolescents' language performance on four elicitation tasks and determine if there are task-related differences across the elicitation tasks.\nMETHOD: Forty-four typically developing adolescents with ages ranging from 12;2 to 17;11 (years;months;\nM =\n15;2; 21 boys and 23 girls) participated in the study. They completed four spoken discourse tasks: (a) story generation using a wordless picture book, (b) fable retell, (c) six personal narratives in response to emotion-based prompts, and (d) monologic response to two stories that contained a moral dilemma. Responses were transcribed and analyzed for four language performance measures tapping into language productivity, syntactic complexity, lexical diversity, and verbal facility.\nRESULTS: Despite individual variability in performance, mean scores were close to median scores for most measures, suggesting a symmetrical distribution. As expected, all four language performance measures were significantly different across the four elicitation tasks. The personal narrative task elicited the longest samples, with the highest verbal fluency. In contrast, both lexical diversity and syntactic complexity were the strongest in response to the fable retell and the moral dilemma tasks.\nCONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides speech-language pathologists with an overview of how task-related factors may impact adolescent language performance. These findings may be used to support their clinical decision-making processes in choosing a suitable discourse task when conducting a comprehensive spoken language assessment. Three hypothetical case examples are used to illustrate the decision-making process.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25761768.\nPMID:\n38748925\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00163",

There is, however, a lack of consensus on (a) how to train educators to deliver the intervention and (b) methods for assessing implementation fidelity. We designed this study to provide preliminary data about the viability of online video modules as an initial training option within a future tiered training model.\nMETHOD: We employed a within-subject repeated-measures group design to evaluate educators' (\nN\n= 20) implementation of DR after viewing training videos. Educators filmed themselves reading three storybooks with a child \"as they would typically\" to establish pretest reading behaviors. After being given access to a series of DR training videos, the educators recorded themselves reading three storybooks with the child using DR strategies as a posttest measure.\nRESULTS: Educators improved their use of individual strategies included in the DR instructional sequence at posttest; however, most participants did not consistently follow the entire instructional sequence as designed. Only one educator delivered the complete DR instructional sequence in > 80% of opportunities at posttest.\nCONCLUSION: Modifications to video training modules and additional coaching support may be warranted for many educators to achieve the level of implementation fidelity needed to improve the child's oral language skills from the intervention.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25749387.\nPMID:\n38718252\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00109",

The purpose of this study was to understand implicit racial and ethnic bias in speech-language pathology students by examining their perceptions and attitudes about the acceptability of racial and ethnic microaggressions. We also examined whether the student ratings varied by their racial and ethnic identity (White vs. people of color [POC]).\nMETHOD: Fifty-nine students (72% White, 28% POC) currently enrolled in a speech-language pathology program voluntarily completed the Acceptability of Racial Microaggressions Scale via an online Qualtrics survey.\nRESULTS: Although 70% of the student ratings classified the microaggressive statements as unacceptable, 30% of their ratings classified the statements as either (a) acceptable or (b) neither acceptable nor unacceptable. Although both groups of students rated the majority of statements as unacceptable, students who self-identified as White rated more statements as acceptable than students who self-identified as POC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings indicating relatively high rejection of microaggressive statements by speech-language pathology students are promising. However, responses were not uniform, and a nontrivial proportion of responses provided by speech-language pathology students reflected passivity toward or active endorsement of microaggressive statements.\nPMID:\n38701432\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00106",

What kind of language indices can we derive from a pre-trained LLM? How do they differ from or relate to the existing language features in aphasia? To what extent can LLMs serve as an interpretable and effective diagnostic and measurement tool in a clinical context? To investigate these questions, we constructed predictive and correlational models, which utilize mean surprisals from LLMs as predictor variables. Using AphasiaBank archived data, we validated our models' efficacy in aphasia diagnosis, measurement, and prediction. Our finding is that LLMs-surprisals can effectively detect the presence of aphasia and different natures of the disorder, LLMs in conjunction with the existing language indices improve models' efficacy in subtyping aphasia, and LLMs-surprisals can capture common agrammatic deficits at both word and sentence level. Overall, LLMs have potential to advance automatic and precise aphasia prediction. A natural language processing pipeline can be greatly benefitted from integrating LLMs, enabling us to refine models of existing language disorders, such as aphasia.\nPMID:\n38971898\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66576-y",

We previously reported that HK-2, an orally active, multifunctional redox modulator (MFRM), was highly effective in reducing both hearing loss and hair cells loss in rats exposed to a moderate intensity workday noise that likely damages the cochlea primarily from oxidative stress versus direct mechanical trauma. To determine if HK-2 could also protect cochlear and vestibular cells from damage caused primarily from direct blast-induced mechanical trauma versus oxidative stress, we exposed rats to six blasts of 186 dB peak SPL. The rats were divided into four groups: (B) blast alone, (BEP) blast plus earplugs, (BHK-2) blast plus HK-2 and (BEPHK-2) blast plus earplugs plus HK-2. HK-2 was orally administered at 50 mg/kg/d from 7-days before to 30-day after the blast exposure. Cochlear and vestibular tissues were harvested 60-d post-exposure and evaluated for loss of outer hair cells (OHC), inner hair cells (IHC), auditory nerve fibers (ANF), spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and vestibular hair cells in the saccule, utricle and semicircular canals. In the untreated blast-exposed group (B), massive losses occurred to OHC, IHC, ANF, SGN and only the vestibular hair cells in the striola region of the saccule. In contrast, rats treated with HK-2 (BHK-2) sustained significantly less OHC (67%) and IHC (57%) loss compared to the B group. OHC and IHC losses were smallest in the BEPHK-2 group, but not significantly different from the BEP group indicating lack of protective synergy between EP and HK-2. There was no loss of ANF, SGN or saccular hair cells in the BHK-2, BEP and BEPHK-2 groups. Thus, HK-2 not only significantly reduced OHC and IHC damage, but completely prevented loss of ANF, SGN and saccule hair cells. The powerful protective effects of this oral MFRM make HK-2 an extremely promising candidate for human clinical trials.\nPMID:\n38961203\n| PMC:\nPMC11222375\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66406-1",

One of the most common causative variants of mtDNA is the m.1555A > G variant of the MT-RNR1 gene (OMIM 561000). Currently the detection of the m.1555A > G variant of the MT-RNR1 gene is not included in all research protocols. In this study this variant was screened among 165 patients with HL from the Republic of Buryatia, located in the Baikal Lake region of Russia. In our study, the total contribution of the m.1555A > G variant to the etiology of HL was 12.7% (21/165), while the update global prevalence of this variant is 1.8% (863/47,328). The m.1555A > G variant was notably more prevalent in Buryat (20.2%) than in Russian patients (1.3%). Mitogenome analysis in 14 unrelated Buryat families carrying the m.1555A > G variant revealed a predominant lineage: in 13 families, a cluster affiliated with sub-haplogroup A5b (92.9%) was identified, while one family had the D5a2a1 lineage (7.1%). In a Russian family with the m.1555A > G variant the lineage affiliated with sub-haplogroup F1a1d was found. Considering that more than 90% of Buryat families with the m.1555A > G variant belong to the single maternal lineage cluster we conclude that high prevalence of this variant in patients with HL in the Baikal Lake region can be attributed to a founder effect.\nPMID:\n38961196\n| PMC:\nPMC11222474\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66254-z",

However, the precise localization of KCNQ4 is still controversial and little is known about the vestibular phenotypes caused by KCNQ4 dysfunction or the specific role of KCNQ4 in the vestibular organs. To investigate the role of KCNQ4 in the vestibular organ, 6-g hypergravity stimulation for 24 h, which represents excessive mechanical stimulation of the sensory epithelium, was applied to p.W277S Kcnq4 transgenic mice. KCNQ4 was detected on the inner surface of calyx of the vestibular afferent in transmission electron microscope images with immunogold labelling. Vestibular function decrease was more severe in the Kcnq4\np.W277S/p.W277S\nmice than in the Kcnq4\n+/+\nand Kcnq4\n+/p.W277S\nmice after the stimulation. The vestibular function loss was resulted from the loss of type 1 vestibular hair cells, which was possibly caused by increased depolarization duration. Retigabine, a KCNQ activator, prevented hypergravity-induced vestibular dysfunction and hair cell loss. Patients with KCNQ4 mutations also showed abnormal clinical vestibular function tests. These findings suggest that KCNQ4 plays an essential role in calyx and afferent of type 1 vestibular hair cell preserving vestibular function against excessive mechanical stimulation.\nPMID:\n38956136\n| PMC:\nPMC11219875\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66115-9",

A tactile vocoder strategy for audio-to-tactile conversion, which exploits these advances, has recently shown significant promise. In this strategy, the amplitude envelope is extracted from several audio frequency bands and used to modulate the amplitude of a set of vibro-tactile tones. The vocoder strategy allows good consonant discrimination, but vowel discrimination is poor and the strategy is susceptible to background noise. In the current study, we assessed whether multi-band amplitude envelope expansion can effectively enhance critical vowel features, such as formants, and improve speech extraction from noise. In 32 participants with normal touch perception, tactile-only phoneme discrimination with and without envelope expansion was assessed both in quiet and in background noise. Envelope expansion improved performance in quiet by 10.3% for vowels and by 5.9% for consonants. In noise, envelope expansion improved overall phoneme discrimination by 9.6%, with no difference in benefit between consonants and vowels. The tactile vocoder with envelope expansion can be deployed in real-time on a compact device and could substantially improve clinical outcomes for a new generation of haptic hearing aids.\nPMID:\n38951556\n| PMC:\nPMC11217272\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-65510-6",

Depression is a common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability. Here, We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach using pooled statistics from genome-wide association studies of ISSHL (1491 cases, 196,592 controls) and depression (23,424 cases, 192,220 controls) in European populations. This study investigated the bidirectional relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with depression and ISSHL using inverse variance weighting.Additional sensitivity analyses, such as Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger), weighted median estimates, and leave-one-out analysis, were performed to assess the reliability of the findings. Significant causal association between genetic susceptibility to ISSHL and depression in a random-effects IVW approach (OR = 1.037, 95% CI = 1.004-1.072, P = 0.030). In contrast, genetic depression was not risk factors for ISSHL (OR = 1.134, 95% CI = 0.871-1.475, P = 0.350). After validation by different MR methods and the sensitivity analysis, all of the above results are consistent.

To this end, we developed a unique, immersive multisensory environment that translates respiratory signals in real-time into dynamic visual and auditory stimuli. The system was evaluated by employing a battery of various psychological assessments, with the findings indicating a significant increase in participants' interoceptive sensibility and an enhancement of the state of flow, signifying immersive and positive engagement with the experience. Furthermore, a correlation between these two variables emerged, revealing a bidirectional enhancement between the state of flow and interoceptive sensibility.

In a prospective, single-blinded study, we utilize pre-operative magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to predict the stiffness of intracranial tumors intraoperatively and assess the impact of increased tumor stiffness on clinical outcomes following microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas. MRE measurements significantly correlated with intraoperative tumor stiffness and baseline hearing status of VS patients. Additionally, MRE stiffness was elevated in patients that underwent sub-total tumor resection compared to gross total resection and those with worse postoperative facial nerve function. Furthermore, we identify tumor microenvironment biomarkers of increased stiffness, including αSMA + myogenic fibroblasts, CD163 + macrophages, and HABP (hyaluronic acid binding protein). In a human VS cell line, a dose-dependent upregulation of HAS1-3, enzymes responsible for hyaluronan synthesis, was observed following stimulation with TNFα, a proinflammatory cytokine present in VS. Taken together, MRE is an accurate, non-invasive predictor of tumor stiffness in VS and meningiomas. VS with increased stiffness portends worse preoperative hearing and poorer postoperative outcomes.

Results of audiometry tests, usually represented graphically in the form of an audiogram, need to be interpreted by a professional audiologist in order to determine the exact type of hearing loss and administer proper treatment. However, the small number of professionals in the field can severely delay proper diagnosis. The presented work proposes a neural network solution for classification of tonal audiometry data. The solution, based on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory architecture, has been devised and evaluated for classifying audiometry results into four classes, representing normal hearing, conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and sensorineural hearing loss. The network was trained using 15,046 test results analysed and categorised by professional audiologists. The proposed model achieves 99.33% classification accuracy on datasets outside of training. In clinical application, the model allows general practitioners to independently classify tonal audiometry results for patient referral. In addition, the proposed solution provides audiologists and otolaryngologists with access to an AI decision support system that has the potential to reduce their burden, improve diagnostic accuracy, and minimise human error.\nPMID:\n38902305\n| PMC:\nPMC11190215\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-64310-2",

This cross-sectional study aimed to better characterize these relationships in a large cohort of prelingually deafened children with CIs (N = 47; mean age = 8.33 years) by comprehensively measuring spectral resolution thresholds (measured via spectral modulation detection), temporal resolution thresholds (measured via sinusoidal amplitude modulation detection), and speech recognition (measured via monosyllabic word recognition, vowel recognition, and sentence recognition in noise via both fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and adaptively varied SNR). Results indicated that neither spectral or temporal resolution were significantly correlated with speech recognition in quiet or noise for children with CIs. Both age and CI experience had a moderate effect on spectral resolution, with significant effects for spectral modulation detection at a modulation rate of 0.5 cyc/oct, suggesting spectral resolution may improve with maturation. Thus, it is possible we may see an emerging relationship between spectral resolution and speech perception over time for children with CIs. While further investigation into this relationship is warranted, these findings demonstrate the need for new investigations to uncover ways of improving spectral resolution for children with CIs.\nPMID:\n38890428\n| PMC:\nPMC11189542\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-63932-w",

A finite element model of the temporal bone with the inner ear, no middle and outer ear structures, and an immobilized stapes footplate was used to assess the directional sensitivity of the cochlea. A concentrated mass represented the bone conduction implant. The harmonic analysis included seventeen frequencies within the hearing range and a full range of excitation directions. Two assessment criteria included: (1) bone vibrations of the round window edge in the direction perpendicular to its surface and (2) the fluid volume displacement of the round window membrane. The direction of maximum bone vibration at the round window edge was perpendicular to the round window. The maximum fluid volume displacement direction was nearly perpendicular to the modiolus axis, almost tangent to the stapes footplate, and inclined slightly to the round window. The direction perpendicular to the stapes footplate resulted in small cochlear responses for both criteria. A key factor responsible for directional sensitivity was the small distance of the excitation point from the cochlea.\nPMID:\n38877090\n| PMC:\nPMC11178818\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-64377-x",

Non-invasive methods to monitor low-grade chronic inflammation may improve the management of older people at risk of poorer outcomes. This longitudinal cohort study has determined baseline inflammation using neopterin volatility in monthly urine samples of 45 independent older adults (aged 65-75 years). Measurement of neopterin, an inflammatory metabolite, enabled stratification of individuals into risk categories based on how often in a 12-month period their neopterin level was raised. Hearing was measured (pure-tone audiometry) at baseline, 1 year and 3 years of the study. Results show that those in the highest risk category (neopterin raised greater than 50% of the time) saw greater deterioration, particularly in high-frequency, hearing. A one-way Welch's ANOVA showed a significant difference between the risk categories for change in high-frequency hearing (W (3, 19.6) = 9.164, p = 0.0005). Despite the study size and duration individuals in the highest risk category were more than twice as likely to have an additional age-related morbidity than those in the lowest risk category.

Hearing preservation requires slow insertion, atraumatic electrode and delivery of the optimal quantity of a pharmacological agent. Several studies have reported variable hearing outcomes with osmotic pump-mediated steroid delivery. New drugs, such as sialyllactose (SL) which have anti-inflammatory effect in many body parts, can prevent tissue overgrowth. In the present study, the positive effects of the pharmacological agent SL against insults were evaluated in vitro using HEI-OC1 cells. An animal model to simulate the damage due to electrode insertion during cochlear implantation was used. SL was delivered using osmotic pumps to prevent loss of the residual hearing in this animal model. Hearing deterioration, tissue fibrosis and ossification were confirmed in this animal model. Increased gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines were identified in the cochleae following dummy electrode insertion. Following the administration of SL, insertion led to a decrease in hearing threshold shifts, tissue reactions, and inflammatory markers. These results emphasize the possible role of SL in hearing preservation and improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying hearing loss after cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38862572\n| PMC:\nPMC11167013\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-62344-0",

Current single-microphone noise reduction algorithms in hearing aids and CIs only remove predictable, stationary noise, and are ineffective against realistic, non-stationary noise such as multi-talker interference. Recent developments in deep neural network (DNN) algorithms have achieved noteworthy performance in speech enhancement and separation, especially in removing speech noise. However, more work is needed to investigate the potential of DNN algorithms in removing speech noise when tested with listeners fitted with CIs. Here, we implemented two DNN algorithms that are well suited for applications in speech audio processing: (1) recurrent neural network (RNN) and (2) SepFormer. The algorithms were trained with a customized dataset ( ∼ 30 h), and then tested with thirteen CI listeners. Both RNN and SepFormer algorithms significantly improved CI listener's speech intelligibility in noise without compromising the perceived quality of speech overall. These algorithms not only increased the intelligibility in stationary non-speech noise, but also introduced a substantial improvement in non-stationary noise, where conventional signal processing strategies fall short with little benefits. These results show the promise of using DNN algorithms as a solution for listening challenges in multi-talker noise interference.\nPMID:\n38853168\n| PMC:\nPMC11163011\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-63675-8",

SIN performance varies drastically, even among individuals with normal hearing. The present genome-wide association study (GWAS) investigated the genetic basis of SIN deficits in individuals with self-reported normal hearing in quiet situations. GWAS was performed on 279,911 individuals from the UB Biobank cohort, with 58,847 reporting SIN deficits despite reporting normal hearing in quiet. GWAS identified 996 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), achieving significance (p < 5*10\n-8\n) across four genomic loci. 720 SNPs across 21 loci achieved suggestive significance (p < 10\n-6\n). GWAS signals were enriched in brain tissues, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior temporal cortex. Cochlear cell types revealed no significant association with SIN deficits. SIN deficits were associated with various health traits, including neuropsychiatric, sensory, cognitive, metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory conditions. A replication analysis was conducted on 242 healthy young adults. Self-reported speech perception, hearing thresholds (0.25-16 kHz), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (1-16 kHz) were utilized for the replication analysis. 73 SNPs were replicated with a self-reported speech perception measure. 211 SNPs were replicated with at least one and 66 with at least two audiological measures. 12 SNPs near or within MAPT, GRM3, and HLA-DQA1 were replicated for all audiological measures.

The results indicate that CI users' voice quality was detrimentally affected by using their CI, raising to the level of a dysphonic voice. Specifically, when using their CI, mean AVQI scores were 4.0 and mean CPPS values were 11.4 dB, which indicates dysphonia.

Nevertheless, research on how voice quality influences listeners' perception, comprehension, and retention of spoken language is limited to a small number of audio-only experiments. We aimed to address this gap by using audio-visual virtual reality (VR) to investigate the impact of a lecturer's hoarseness on university students' heard text recall, listening effort, and listening impression. Fifty participants were immersed in a virtual seminar room, where they engaged in a Dual-Task Paradigm. They listened to narratives presented by a virtual female professor, who spoke in either a typical or hoarse voice. Simultaneously, participants performed a secondary task. Results revealed significantly prolonged secondary-task response times with the hoarse voice compared to the typical voice, indicating increased listening effort. Subjectively, participants rated the hoarse voice as more annoying, effortful to listen to, and impeding for their cognitive performance. No effect of voice quality was found on heard text recall, suggesting that, while hoarseness may compromise certain aspects of spoken language processing, this might not necessarily result in reduced information retention. In summary, our findings underscore the importance of promoting vocal health among lecturers, which may contribute to enhanced listening conditions in learning spaces.\nPMID:\n38811832\n| PMC:\nPMC11137055\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-63097-6",
