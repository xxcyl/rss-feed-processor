Results of pure-tone audiometry and immittance measures are also presented. Nationally representative datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 2011 to 2012, 2015 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, the three most recent NHANES datasets with audiological information, were used.\nRESULTS: The NHANES datasets indicated that there are 49.5 million adults in the United States with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing trouble. Results indicated that OTC hearing-aid candidates are most frequently 50 to 69 years of age, married, and identify as non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity. Most of these individuals graduated from high school, had several risk factors for hearing loss, had not had a hearing test in the past 5 years, and had never used hearing aids or assistive listening devices previously. The typical audiometric profile was a bilaterally symmetrical sloping hearing loss with slight to mild hearing loss above 2000 Hz. Group data showed normal immittance measures and absence of otoscopic abnormalities except for the presence of excessive (not impacted) cerumen in about 13% of the OTC hearing-aid candidates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tens of millions of US adults have perceived mild-to-moderate hearing trouble but have not pursued assistance, either through obtaining a hearing test or acquiring prescription hearing aids.\nPMID:\n38816904\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001514",

Often, measures of peripheral auditory functions are within normal ranges, making clinicians feel unsure about proper management strategies. The range and nature of observed or experienced difficulties might be better captured using a qualitative measure. The Evaluation of Children's Listening and Processing Skills (ECLiPS) questionnaire was designed to broadly profile the auditory and cognitive problems often present in children with listening difficulties. This 38-item questionnaire was initially standardized in British children aged 6 to 11 years, was subsequently modified for use with North-American children, and was recently translated into Flemish-Dutch. This study aimed to compare typical scores of the Flemish version with the UK and US versions, and to evaluate and compare its psychometric quality based on Rasch analysis.\nDESIGN: We selected 112 Flemish children aged 6 to 11 years with verified normal hearing and typical development, and asked two caregivers of every child to fill out the ECLiPS. Data from two comparator samples were analyzed, including responses for 71 North-American children and 650 British children. Typical values for ECLiPS factors and aggregates were determined as a function of age and gender, and meaningful differences across samples were analyzed. Rasch analyses were performed to evaluate whether ECLiPS response categories work as intended, and whether item scores fit a linear equal interval measurement scale that works the same way for everyone. Item and person metrics were derived, including separation and reliability indices. We investigated whether items function similarly across linguistically and culturally different samples.\nRESULTS: ECLiPS scores were relatively invariant to age. Girls obtained higher scores compared with boys, mainly for items related to memory and attention, and pragmatic and social skills. Across ECLiPS versions, the most pronounced differences were found for items probing social skills. With respect to its psychometric quality, ECLiPS response categories work as intended, and ECLiPS items were found to fit the Rasch measurement scale. Cultural differences in responses were noted for some items, belonging to different factors. Item separation and reliability indices generally pointed toward sufficient variation in item difficulty. In general, person separation (and reliability) metrics, quantifying the instrument's ability to distinguish between poor and strong performers (in a reproducible manner), were low. This is expected from samples of typically developing children with homogeneous and high levels of listening ability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Across the languages assessed here, the ECLiPS caregiver questionnaire was verified to be a psychometrically valid qualitative measure to assess listening and processing skills, which can be used to support the assessment and management of elementary school children referred with LiD.\nPMID:\n38825739\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001509",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Objective estimation of minimum hearing levels using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) elicited by single frequency tone-bursts presented monaurally is currently considered the gold standard. However, the data acquisition time to estimate thresholds (for both ears across four audiometric frequencies) using this method usually exceeds the sleep time (ranging between 35 and 49 minutes) in infants below 4 months, thus providing incomplete information of hearing status which in turn delays timely clinical intervention. Alternate approaches using faster rate, or tone-burst trains have not been readily accepted due to additional hardware and software requirements. We propose here a novel binaural multifrequency stimulation paradigm wherein several stimuli of different frequencies are presented binaurally in an interleaved manner. The rationale here is that the proposed paradigm will increase acquisition efficiency, significantly reduce test time, and improve accuracy by incorporating an automatic wave V detection algorithm. It is important to note that this paradigm can be easily implemented in most commercial ABR systems currently used by most clinicians.\nDESIGN: Using this binaural multifrequency paradigm, ear specific ABRs were recorded in 30 normal-hearing young adults to both tone-bursts, and narrow-band (NB) iChirps at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Comparison of ABRs elicited by tone-bursts and narrow-band chirps allowed us to determine if NB iChirps elicited a more robust wave V component compared with the tone-bursts. ABR data were characterized by measures of minimum hearing levels; wave V amplitude; and response detectability for two electrode configurations (high forehead-C7; and high forehead-linked mastoids).\nRESULTS: Consistent with the research literature, wave V response amplitudes were relatively more robust for NB iChirp stimuli compared with tone-burst stimuli. The easier identification and better detectability of wave V for the NB iChirps at lower stimulus levels contributed to their better thresholds compared with tone-burst elicited responses. It is important to note that binaural multifrequency hearing levels close to minimum hearing levels were determined in approximately 22 minutes using this paradigm-appreciably quicker than the 45 to 60 minutes or longer time required for threshold determination using the conventional single frequency method.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel and simple paradigm using either NB iChirps or tone-bursts provides a reliable method to rapidly estimate the minimum hearing levels across audiometric frequencies for both ears. Incorporation of an automatic wave V detection algorithm increases objectivity and further reduce test time and facilitate early hearing identification and intervention.\nPMID:\n38825740\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001535",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Speech recognition in cochlear implant (CI) recipients is quite variable, particularly in challenging listening conditions. Demographic, audiological, and cognitive factors explain some, but not all, of this variance. The literature suggests that rapid auditory perceptual learning explains unique variance in speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and those with hearing loss. The present study focuses on the early adaptation phase of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning. It investigates whether adult CI recipients exhibit this learning and, if so, whether it accounts for portions of the variance in their recognition of fast speech and speech in noise.\nDESIGN: Thirty-six adult CI recipients (ages = 35 to 77, M = 55) completed a battery of general speech recognition tests (sentences in speech-shaped noise, four-talker babble noise, and natural-fast speech), cognitive measures (vocabulary, working memory, attention, and verbal processing speed), and a rapid auditory perceptual learning task with time-compressed speech. Accuracy in the general speech recognition tasks was modeled with a series of generalized mixed models that accounted for demographic, audiological, and cognitive factors before accounting for the contribution of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning of time-compressed speech.\nRESULTS: Most CI recipients exhibited early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning of time-compressed speech within the course of the first 20 sentences. This early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning had unique contribution to the recognition of natural-fast speech in quiet and speech in noise, although the contribution to natural-fast speech may reflect the rapid learning that occurred in this task. When accounting for demographic and cognitive characteristics, an increase of 1 SD in the early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning rate was associated with ~52% increase in the odds of correctly recognizing natural-fast speech in quiet, and ~19% to 28% in the odds of correctly recognizing the different types of speech in noise. Age, vocabulary, attention, and verbal processing speed also had unique contributions to general speech recognition. However, their contribution varied between the different general speech recognition tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous findings in other populations, in CI recipients, early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual, learning also accounts for some of the individual differences in the recognition of speech in noise and natural-fast speech in quiet. Thus, across populations, the early rapid adaptation phase of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning might serve as a skill that supports speech recognition in various adverse conditions. In CI users, the ability to rapidly adapt to ongoing acoustical challenges may be one of the factors associated with good CI outcomes. Overall, CI recipients with higher cognitive resources and faster rapid learning rates had better speech recognition.\nPMID:\n38829780\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001523",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Recently, the HEAR-aware app was developed to support adults who are eligible for hearing aids (HAs) but not yet ready to use them. The app serves as a self-management tool, offering assistance for a range of target behaviors (TBs), such as communication strategies and emotional coping. Using ecological momentary assessment and intervention, the app prompts users to complete brief surveys regarding challenging listening situations they encounter in their daily lives (ecological momentary assessment). In response, users receive educational content in the form of \"snippets\" (videos, texts, web links) on the TBs, some of which are customized based on the reported acoustic environmental characteristics (ecological momentary intervention). The primary objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the HEAR-aware app in enhancing readiness to take action on various TBs and evaluate its impact on secondary outcomes. The secondary objective was to examine the app's usability, usefulness, and user satisfaction.\nMETHODS: A randomized controlled trial design with two arms was used. Participants with hearing loss aged 50 years and over were recruited via an HA retailer and randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 42, mean age = 65 years [SD = 9.1]) or the control group (n = 45, mean age = 68 years [SD 8.7]). The intervention group used the app during 4 weeks. The control group received no intervention. All participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), and again 4 weeks later (T2). Participants' readiness to take action on five TBs was measured with The Line Composite. A list of secondary outcomes was used. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using Linear Mixed effect Models including group (intervention/control), time (T0/T1/T2), and Group × Time Interactions. In addition, a per protocol analysis was carried out to explore whether effects depended on app usage. For the secondary aim the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, item 4 of the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Intervention (IOI-AI), and a recommendation item were used (intervention group only at T1).\nRESULTS: For objective 1, there was no significant group difference for The Line Composite over the course of T0, T1, and T2. However, a significant (p = 0.033) Group × Time Interaction was found for The Line Emotional coping, with higher increase in readiness to take action on emotional coping in the intervention group than in the control group. The intention-to-treat analyses revealed no other significant group differences, but the per protocol analyses showed that participants in the intervention group were significantly more ready to take up Assistive Listening Devices (The Line Assistive Listening Devices) and less ready to take up HAs (Staging Algorithm HAs) than the control group (p = 0.049). Results for objective 2 showed that on average, participants rated the app as moderately useful (mean Intrinsic Motivation Inventory score 5 out of 7) and its usability as \"marginal\" (mean SUS score 68 out of 100) with about half of the participants rating the app as \"good\" (SUS score >70) and a minority rating is as \"unacceptable\" (SUS score ≤50).\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of self-management support tools like the HEAR-aware app in the rehabilitation of adults with hearing loss who are not yet ready for HAs. The range in usability scores suggest that it may not be a suitable intervention for everyone.\nPMID:\n38831480\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001533",

A total of 105 participants with moderate-to-profound hearing loss (HL) and 54 with normal hearing were enrolled in the validation process. The participants with HL were fitted with bilateral hearing aids, bimodal hearing, or bilateral cochlear implants. The C-SSQ-P was administered to the parents of participants aged 3 to 6.9 years, and the C-SSQ-C was administered to participants aged 7 to 18 years. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity were evaluated for both questionnaires.\nRESULTS: Both C-SSQ-P and C-SSQ-C demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α >0.8) and good validity (generalized linear model revealed significant negative relationships between the C-SSQ-P subscales with aided better-hearing threshold [β = -0.08 to -0.12, p ≤ 0.001] and between the C-SSQ-C subscales with worse-hearing threshold [β = -0.13 to -0.14, p < 0.001]). Among the children with HL, the participants with bilateral cochlear implants had demonstrated better performance than those with bimodal hearing and bilateral hearing aids, as evidenced by the highest mean scores in three subscales.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both C-SSQ-P and C-SSQ-C are reliable and valid for assessing HL in children and adolescents. The C-SSQ-P is applicable in evaluating young children aged 3 to 6.9 years after a 7-day observation period, while the C-SSQ-C is appropriate for children and adolescents aged 7 to 18 years.\nPMID:\n38831494\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001525",

In particular, linguistic context allows the use of several cognitive mechanisms that are not well distinguished in hearing science, namely those relating to \"postdiction\", \"integration\", and \"prediction\". We offer the perspective that an unacknowledged impact of hearing loss is the differential use of predictive mechanisms relative to age-matched individuals with normal hearing. As evidence, we first review how degraded auditory input leads to reduced prediction in people with normal hearing, then consider the literature exploring context use in people with acquired postlingual hearing loss. We argue that no research on hearing loss has directly assessed prediction. Because current interventions for hearing do not fully alleviate difficulty in conversation, and avoidance of spoken social interaction may be a mediator between hearing loss and cognitive decline, this perspective could lead to greater understanding of cognitive effects of hearing loss and provide insight regarding new targets for intervention.\nPMID:\n38880953\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001515",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Modern cochlear implants (CIs) use varying-length electrode arrays inserted at varying insertion angles within variably sized cochleae. Thus, there exists an opportunity to enhance CI performance, particularly in postlinguistic adults, by optimizing the frequency-to-place allocation for electrical stimulation, thereby minimizing the need for central adaptation and plasticity. There has been interest in applying Greenwood or Stakhovskaya et al. function (describing the tonotopic map) to postoperative imaging of electrodes to improve frequency allocation and place coding. Acoustically-evoked electrocochleography (ECochG) allows for electrophysiologic best-frequency (BF) determination of CI electrodes and the potential for creating a personalized frequency allocation function. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between early speech-perception performance and frequency-to-place mismatch.\nDESIGN: This retrospective study included 50 patients who received a slim perimodiolar electrode array. Following electrode insertion, five acoustic pure-tone stimuli ranging from 0.25 to 2 kHz were presented, and electrophysiological measurements were collected across all 22 electrode contacts. Cochlear microphonic tuning curves were subsequently generated for each stimulus frequency to ascertain the BF electrode or the location corresponding to the maximum response amplitude. Subsequently, we calculated the difference between the stimulus frequency and the patient's CI map's actual frequency allocation at each BF electrode, reflecting the frequency-to-place mismatch. BF electrocochleography-total response (BF-ECochG-TR), a measure of cochlear health, was also evaluated for each subject to control for the known impact of this measure on performance.\nRESULTS: Our findings showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.23 to 0.76) between the cumulative frequency-to-place mismatch, as determined using the ECochG-derived BF map (utilizing 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), and 3-month performance on consonant-nucleus-consonant words (N = 38). Larger positive mismatches, shifted basal from the BF map, led to enhanced speech perception. Incorporating BF-ECochG-TR, total mismatch, and their interaction in a multivariate model explained 62% of the variance in consonant-nucleus-consonant word scores at 3 months. BF-ECochG-TR as a standalone predictor tended to overestimate performance for subjects with larger negative total mismatches and underestimated the performance for those with larger positive total mismatches. Neither cochlear diameter, number of cochlear turns, nor apical insertion angle accounted for the variability in total mismatch.\nCONCLUSIONS: Comparison of ECochG-BF derived tonotopic electrode maps to the frequency allocation tables reveals substantial mismatch, explaining 26.0% of the variability in CI performance in quiet. Closer examination of the mismatch shows that basally shifted maps at high frequencies demonstrate superior performance at 3 months compared with those with apically shifted maps (toward Greenwood and Stakhovskaya et al.). The implications of these results suggest that electrophysiological-based frequency reallocation might lead to enhanced speech-perception performance, especially when compared with conventional manufacturer maps or anatomic-based mapping strategies. Future research, exploring the prospective use of ECochG-based mapping techniques for frequency allocation is underway.\nPMID:\n38880958\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001528",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Listening effort involves the mental effort required to perceive an auditory stimulus, for example in noisy environments. Prolonged increased listening effort, for example due to impaired hearing ability, may increase risk of health complications. It is therefore important to identify valid and sensitive measures of listening effort. Physiological measures have been shown to be sensitive to auditory task demand manipulations and are considered to reflect changes in listening effort. Such measures include pupil dilation, alpha power, skin conductance level, and heart rate variability. The aim of the current systematic review was to provide an overview of studies to listening effort that used multiple physiological measures. The two main questions were: (1) what is the effect of changes in auditory task demand on simultaneously acquired physiological measures from various modalities? and (2) what is the relationship between the responses in these physiological measures?\nDESIGN: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, relevant articles were sought in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science and by examining the references of included articles. Search iterations with different combinations of psychophysiological measures were performed in conjunction with listening effort-related search terms. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies.\nRESULTS: A total of 297 articles were identified from three databases, of which 27 were included. One additional article was identified from reference lists. Of the total 28 included articles, 16 included an analysis regarding the relationship between the physiological measures. The overall quality of the included studies was reasonable.\nCONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that most of the physiological measures either show no effect to auditory task demand manipulations or a consistent effect in the expected direction. For example, pupil dilation increased, pre-ejection period decreased, and skin conductance level increased with increasing auditory task demand. Most of the relationships between the responses of these physiological measures were nonsignificant or weak. The physiological measures varied in their sensitivity to auditory task demand manipulations. One of the identified knowledge gaps was that the included studies mostly used tasks with high-performance levels, resulting in an underrepresentation of the physiological changes at lower performance levels. This makes it difficult to capture how the physiological responses behave across the full psychometric curve. Our results support the Framework for Understanding Effortful Listening and the need for a multimodal approach to listening effort. We furthermore discuss focus points for future studies.\nPMID:\n38880960\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001508",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Recently, the Noise-Tolerance Domains Test (NTDT) was applied to study the noise-tolerance domains used by young normal-hearing (NH) listeners during noise acceptance decisions. In this study, we examined how subjective speech intelligibility may drive noise acceptance decisions by applying the NTDT on NH and hearing-impaired (HI) listeners at the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) around the Tracking of Noise-Tolerance (TNT) thresholds.\nDESIGN: A single-blind, within-subjects design with 22 NH and 17 HI older adults was followed. Listeners completed the TNT to determine the average noise acceptance threshold (TNTAve). Then, listeners completed the NTDT at the SNRs of 0, ±3 dB (re: TNTAve) to estimate the weighted noise-tolerance domain ratings (WNTDRs) for each domain criterion. Listeners also completed the Objective and Subjective Intelligibility Difference (OSID) Test to establish the individual intelligibility performance-intensity (P-I) functions of the TNT materials. All test measures were conducted at 75 and 82 dB SPL speech input levels. NH and HI listeners were tested in the unaided mode. The HI listeners were also tested using a study hearing aid. The WNTDRs were plotted against subjective speech intelligibilities extrapolated from individual P-I of the OSID at the SNRs corresponding to NTDT test conditions. Listeners were grouped according to their most heavily weighed domain and a regression analysis was performed against listener demographics as well as TNT and OSID performances to determine which variable(s) affected listener grouping.\nRESULTS: Three linear mixed effects (LMEs) models were used to examine whether WNTDRs changed with subjective speech intelligibility. All three LMEs found significant fixed effects of domain criteria, subjective intelligibility, and speech input level on WNTDRs. In general, heavier weights were assigned to speech interference and loudness domains at poorer intelligibility levels (<50%) with reversals to distraction and annoyance at higher intelligibility levels (>80%). The comparison between NH and HI-unaided showed that NH listeners assigned greater weights to loudness than the HI-unaided listeners. The comparison between NH and HI-aided groups showed similar weights between groups. The comparison between HI-unaided and HI-aided found that HI listeners assigned lower weights to speech interference and greater weights to loudness when tested in aided compared with unaided modes. In all comparisons, loudness was weighed heavier at the 82 dB SPL input level than at the 75 dB SPL input level with greater weights to annoyance in the NH versus HI-unaided comparison and lower weights to distraction in the HI-aided versus HI-unaided comparison. A generalized linear model determined that listener grouping was best accounted for by subjective speech intelligibility estimated at TNTAve.\nCONCLUSIONS: The domain criteria used by listeners were driven by their subjective speech intelligibility regardless of their hearing status (i.e., NH versus HI). In general, when subjective intelligibility was poor, the domains of speech interference and loudness were weighed the heaviest. As subjective intelligibility improved, the weightings on annoyance and distraction increased. Furthermore, a listener's criterion for >90% subjective speech understanding at the TNTAve may allow one to profile the listener.\nPMID:\n38880961\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001536",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: In clinical and laboratory settings, speech recognition is typically assessed in a way that cannot distinguish accurate auditory perception from misperception that was mentally repaired or inferred from context. Previous work showed that the process of repairing misperceptions elicits greater listening effort, and that this elevated effort lingers well after the sentence is heard. That result suggests that cognitive repair strategies might appear successful when testing a single utterance but fail for everyday continuous conversational speech. The present study tested the hypothesis that the effort of repairing misperceptions has the consequence of carrying over to interfere with perception of later words after the sentence.\nDESIGN: Stimuli were open-set coherent sentences that were presented intact or with a word early in the sentence replaced with noise, forcing the listener to use later context to mentally repair the missing word. Sentences were immediately followed by digit triplets, which served to probe carryover effort from the sentence. Control conditions allowed for the comparison to intact sentences that did not demand mental repair, as well as to listening conditions that removed the need to attend to the post-sentence stimuli, or removed the post-sentence digits altogether. Intelligibility scores for the sentences and digits were accompanied by time-series measurements of pupil dilation to assess cognitive load during the task, as well as subjective rating of effort. Participants included adults with cochlear implants (CIs), as well as an age-matched group and a younger group of listeners with typical hearing for comparison.\nRESULTS: For the CI group, needing to repair a missing word during a sentence resulted in more errors on the digits after the sentence, especially when the repair process did not result in a coherent sensible perception. Sentences that needed repair also contained more errors on the words that were unmasked. All groups showed substantial increase of pupil dilation when sentences required repair, even when the repair was successful. Younger typical hearing listeners showed clear differences in moment-to-moment allocation of effort in the different conditions, while the other groups did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: For CI listeners, the effort of needing to repair misperceptions in a sentence can last long enough to interfere with words that follow the sentence. This pattern could pose a serious problem for regular communication but would go overlooked in typical testing with single utterances, where a listener has a chance to repair misperceptions before responding. Carryover effort was not predictable by basic intelligibility scores, but can be revealed in behavioral data when sentences are followed immediately by extra probe words such as digits.\nPMID:\n38886880\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001537",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: We investigated whether listening effort is dependent on task difficulty for cochlear implant (CI) users when using the Matrix speech-in-noise test. To this end, we measured peak pupil dilation (PPD) at a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNR) by systematically changing the noise level at a constant speech level, and vice versa.\nDESIGN: A group of mostly elderly CI users performed the Dutch/Flemish Matrix test in quiet and in multitalker babble at different SNRs. SNRs were set relative to the speech-recognition threshold (SRT), namely at SRT, and 5 and 10 dB above SRT (0 dB, +5 dB, and +10 dB re SRT). The latter 2 conditions were obtained by either varying speech level (at a fixed noise level of 60 dBA) or by varying noise level (with a fixed speech level). We compared these PPDs with those of a group of typical hearing (TH) listeners. In addition, listening effort was assessed with subjective ratings on a Likert scale.\nRESULTS: PPD for the CI group did not significantly depend on SNR, whereas SNR significantly affected PPDs for TH listeners. Subjective effort ratings depended significantly on SNR for both groups. For CI users, PPDs were significantly larger, and effort was rated higher when speech was varied, and noise was fixed for CI users. By contrast, for TH listeners effort ratings were significantly higher and performance scores lower when noise was varied, and speech was fixed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of a significant effect of varying SNR on PPD suggests that the Matrix test may not be a feasible speech test for measuring listening effort with pupillometric measures for CI users. A rating test appeared more promising in this population, corroborating earlier reports that subjective measures may reflect different dimensions of listening effort than pupil dilation. Establishing the SNR by varying speech or noise level can have subtle, but significant effects on measures of listening effort, and these effects can differ between TH listeners and CI users.\nPMID:\n38886888\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001529",

This investigation draws on hearing data from 5 to 13 years and again at 45 years of age, to explore the associations between childhood hearing variables and hearing and listening ability at age 45.\nDESIGN: Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between childhood hearing (otological status and mid-frequency pure-tone average) and (a) age 45 peripheral hearing ability (mid-frequency pure-tone average and high-frequency pure-tone average), and (b) age 45 listening ability (listening in spatialized noise and subjective questionnaire on listening experiences).

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: A wide variety of intraoperative tests are available in cochlear implantation. However, no consensus exists on which tests constitute the minimum necessary battery. We assembled an international panel of clinical experts to develop, refine, and vote upon a set of core consensus statements.\nDESIGN: A literature review was used to identify intraoperative tests currently used in the field and draft a set of provisional statements. For statement evaluation and refinement, we used a modified Delphi consensus panel structure. Multiple interactive rounds of voting, evaluation, and feedback were conducted to achieve convergence.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine provisional statements were included in the original draft. In the first voting round, consensus was reached on 15 statements. Of the 14 statements that did not reach consensus, 12 were revised based on feedback provided by the expert practitioners, and 2 were eliminated. In the second voting round, 10 of the 12 revised statements reached a consensus. The two statements which did not achieve consensus were further revised and subjected to a third voting round. However, both statements failed to achieve consensus in the third round. In addition, during the final revision, one more statement was decided to be deleted due to overlap with another modified statement.\nCONCLUSIONS: A final core set of 24 consensus statements was generated, covering wide areas of intraoperative testing during CI surgery. These statements may provide utility as evidence-based guidelines to improve quality and achieve uniformity of surgical practice.\nPMID:\n38915137\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001526",

In the auditory system, sex differences have been observed in cochlear physiology and responses to pathological conditions. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences remain elusive. The current research explores the differences in gene expression profiles in the cochlea between male and female mice, aiming to understand the functional implication of sex-biased gene expression in each sex. Using RNA-sequencing analysis on cochlear tissues obtained from male and female mice, we identified a significant number of genes exhibiting sex-biased expression differences. While some of these differentially expressed genes are located on sex chromosomes, most are found on autosomal chromosomes. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that these genes are involved in several key cellular functions. In males, these genes are notably linked to oxidative phosphorylation and RNA synthesis and processing, suggesting their involvement in mitochondrial energy production and regulatory control of gene expression. In contrast, sex-biased genes are associated with mechano-transduction and synaptic transmission within female cochleae. Collectively, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular differences between the sexes and emphasizes the need for future research to uncover their functional implications and relevance to auditory health and disease development.\nPMID:\n38776705\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109030",

Outcomes are impressive and most recipients attain excellent speech comprehension in quiet without relying on lip-reading cues, but pitch resolution is poor compared to normal hearing. Amplitude modulation of electrical stimulation is a primary cue for pitch perception in cochlear implant users. The experiments described in this article focus on the relationship between sensitivity to amplitude modulations and pitch resolution based on changes in the frequency of amplitude modulations. In the first experiment, modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution were measured in adults with no known hearing loss and in cochlear implant users with sounds presented to and processed by their clinical devices. Stimuli were amplitude-modulated sinusoids and amplitude-modulated narrow-band noises. Modulation detection and modulation frequency discrimination were measured for modulation frequencies centered on 110, 220, and 440 Hz. Pitch resolution based on changes in modulation frequency was measured for modulation depths of 25 %, 50 %, 100 %, and for a half-waved rectified modulator. Results revealed a strong linear relationship between modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution for cochlear implant users and peers with no known hearing loss. In the second experiment, cochlear implant users took part in analogous procedures of modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution but bypassing clinical sound processing using single-electrode stimulation. Results indicated that modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution was better conveyed by single-electrode stimulation than by clinical processors. Results at 440 Hz were worse, but also not well conveyed by clinical sound processing, so it remains unclear whether the 300 Hz perceptual limit described in the literature is a technological or biological limitation. These results highlight modulation depth and sensitivity as critical factors for pitch resolution in cochlear implant users and characterize the relationship that should inform the design of modulation enhancement algorithms for cochlear implants.\nPMID:\n38776706\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109026",

Epub 2024 May 17.\nABSTRACT\nOlder listeners have difficulty processing temporal cues that are important for word discrimination, and deficient processing may limit their ability to benefit from these cues. Here, we investigated aging effects on perception and neural representation of the consonant transition and the factors that contribute to successful perception. To further understand the neural mechanisms underlying the changes in processing from brainstem to cortex, we also examined the factors that contribute to exaggerated amplitudes in cortex. We enrolled 30 younger normal-hearing and 30 older normal-hearing participants who met the criteria of clinically normal hearing. Perceptual identification functions were obtained for the words BEAT and WHEAT on a 7-step continuum of consonant-transition duration. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded to click stimuli and frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical auditory-evoked potentials were recorded to the endpoints of the BEAT-WHEAT continuum. Perceptual performance for identification of BEAT vs. WHEAT did not differ between younger and older listeners. However, both subcortical and cortical measures of neural representation showed age group differences, such that FFR phase locking was lower but cortical amplitudes (P1 and N1) were higher in older compared to younger listeners. ABR Wave I amplitude and FFR phase locking, but not audiometric thresholds, predicted early cortical amplitudes. Phase locking to the transition region and early cortical peak amplitudes (P1) predicted performance on the perceptual identification function. Overall, results suggest that the neural representation of transition durations and cortical overcompensation may contribute to the ability to perceive transition duration contrasts. Cortical overcompensation appears to be a maladaptive response to decreased neural firing/synchrony.\nPMID:\n38781768\n| PMC:\nPMC11156531\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109034",

Epub 2024 May 17.\nABSTRACT\nNeurons within a neuronal network can be grouped by bottom-up and top-down influences using synchrony in neuronal oscillations. This creates the representation of perceptual objects from sensory features. Oscillatory activity can be differentiated into stimulus-phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced). The former is mainly determined by sensory input, the latter by higher-level (cortical) processing. Effects of auditory deprivation on cortical oscillations have been studied in congenitally deaf cats (CDCs) using cochlear implant (CI) stimulation. CI-induced alpha, beta, and gamma activity were compromised in the auditory cortex of CDCs. Furthermore, top-down information flow between secondary and primary auditory areas in hearing cats, conveyed by induced alpha oscillations, was lost in CDCs. Here we used the matching pursuit algorithm to assess components of such oscillatory activity in local field potentials recorded in primary field A1. Additionally to the loss of induced alpha oscillations, we also found a loss of evoked theta activity in CDCs. The loss of theta and alpha activity in CDCs can be directly related to reduced high-frequency (gamma-band) activity due to cross-frequency coupling. Here we quantified such cross-frequency coupling in adult 1) hearing-experienced, acoustically stimulated cats (aHCs), 2) hearing-experienced cats following acute pharmacological deafening and subsequent CIs, thus in electrically stimulated cats (eHCs), and 3) electrically stimulated CDCs. We found significant cross-frequency coupling in all animal groups in > 70% of auditory-responsive sites. The predominant coupling in aHCs and eHCs was between theta/alpha phase and gamma power. In CDCs such coupling was lost and replaced by alpha oscillations coupling to delta/theta phase. Thus, alpha/theta oscillations synchronize high-frequency gamma activity only in hearing-experienced cats. The absence of induced alpha and theta oscillations contributes to the loss of induced gamma power in CDCs, thereby signifying impaired local network activity.\nPMID:\n38797035\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109032",

Epub 2024 May 20.\nABSTRACT\nHearing loss is well known to cause plastic changes in the central auditory system and pathological changes such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. Impairment of inner ear functions is the main cause of hearing loss. In aged individuals, not only inner ear dysfunction but also senescence of the central nervous system is the cause of malfunction of the auditory system. In most cases of hearing loss, the activity of the auditory nerve is reduced, but that of the successive auditory centers is increased in a compensatory way. It has been reported that activity changes occur in the inferior colliculus (IC), a critical nexus of the auditory pathway. The IC integrates the inputs from the brainstem and drives the higher auditory centers. Since abnormal activity in the IC is likely to affect auditory perception, it is crucial to elucidate the neuronal mechanism to induce the activity changes of IC neurons with hearing loss. This review outlines recent findings on hearing-loss-induced plastic changes in the IC and brainstem auditory neuronal circuits and discusses what neuronal mechanisms underlie hearing-loss-induced changes in the activity of IC neurons. Considering the different causes of hearing loss, we discuss age-related hearing loss separately from other forms of hearing loss (non-age-related hearing loss). In general, the main plastic change of IC neurons caused by both age-related and non-age-related hearing loss is increased central gain. However, plastic changes in the IC caused by age-related hearing loss seem to be more complex than those caused by non-age-related hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38797036\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109033",

Epub 2024 May 25.\nABSTRACT\nAlthough rats and mice are among the preferred animal models for investigating many characteristics of auditory function, they are rarely used to study an essential aspect of binaural hearing: the ability of animals to localize the sources of low-frequency sounds by detecting the interaural time difference (ITD), that is the difference in the time at which the sound arrives at each ear. In mammals, ITDs are mostly encoded in the medial superior olive (MSO), one of the main nuclei of the superior olivary complex (SOC). Because of their small heads and high frequency hearing range, rats and mice are often considered unable to use ITDs for sound localization. Moreover, their MSO is frequently viewed as too small or insignificant compared to that of mammals that use ITDs to localize sounds, including cats and gerbils. However, recent research has demonstrated remarkable similarities between most morphological and physiological features of mouse MSO neurons and those of MSO neurons of mammals that use ITDs. In this context, we have analyzed the structure and neural afferent and efferent connections of the rat MSO, which had never been studied by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into the nucleus. The rat MSO spans the SOC longitudinally. It is relatively small caudally, but grows rostrally into a well-developed column of stacked bipolar neurons. By placing small, precise injections of the bidirectional tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the MSO, we show that this nucleus is innervated mainly by the most ventral and rostral spherical bushy cells of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus of both sides, and by the most ventrolateral principal neurons of the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. The same experiments reveal that the MSO densely innervates the most dorsolateral region of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, the central region of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and the most lateral region of the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus of its own side. Therefore, the MSO is selectively innervated by, and sends projections to, neurons that process low-frequency sounds. The structural and hodological features of the rat MSO are notably similar to those of the MSO of cats and gerbils. While these similarities raise the question of what functions other than ITD coding the MSO performs, they also suggest that the rat MSO is an appropriate model for future MSO-centered research.\nPMID:\n38797037\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109036",

Despite recent advances in our understanding of tinnitus, there are limited options for effective treatment. Tinnitus treatments are made more complicated by the lack of a test for tinnitus based on objectively measured physiological characteristics. Such an objective test would enable a greater understanding of tinnitus mechanisms and may lead to faster treatment development in both animal and human research. This review makes the argument that an objective tinnitus test, such as a non-invasive electrophysiological measure, is desperately needed. We review the current tinnitus assessment methods, the underlying neural correlates of tinnitus, the multiple tinnitus generation theories, and the previously investigated electrophysiological measurements of tinnitus. Finally, we propose an alternate objective test for tinnitus that may be valid in both animal and human subjects.\nPMID:\n38810373\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109046",

MiRNA level was detected by RT-qPCR, proteins by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Morphology of autophagosomes was observed by electron microscopy. In vivo, the cochlea of aged mice showed higher miR-130b-3p expression and lower PPARγ expression, while exogenous inhibition of miR-130b-3p up-regulated PPARγ expression. Autophagy-related biomarkers expression (ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3B II/I) decreased in aged mice, which reversely increased after the inhibition of miR-130b-3p. The elevation of PPARγ demonstrated similar effects. Contrarily, exogenous overexpression of miR-130b-3p resulted in the decrease of ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3B II/I. We created oxidative stress within HEI-OC1 by H\n2\nO\n2\n, subsequently observed the formation of autophagosomes under electron microscope, so as the elevated cell apoptosis rate and weakened cell viability.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe round window (RW) membrane plays an important role in normal inner ear mechanics. Occlusion or reinforcement of the RW has been described in the context of congenital anomalies or after cochlear implantation and is applied as a surgical treatment for hyperacusis. Multiple lumped and finite element models predict a low-frequency hearing loss with air conduction of up to 20 dB after RW reinforcement and limited to no effect on hearing with bone conduction stimulation. Experimental verification of these results, however, remains limited. Here, we present an experimental study measuring the impact of RW reinforcement on the middle and inner ear mechanics with air and bone conduction stimulation. In a within-specimen repeated measures design with human cadaveric specimens (n = 6), we compared the intracochlear pressures in scala vestibuli (P\nSV\n) and scala tympani (P\nST\n) before and after RW reinforcement with soft tissue, cartilage, and bone cement. The differential pressure (P\nDIFF\n) across the basilar membrane - known to be closely related to the hearing sensation - was calculated as the complex difference between P\nSV\nand P\nST\n. With air conduction stimulation, both P\nSV\nand P\nST\nincreased on average up to 22 dB at frequencies below 1500 Hz with larger effect sizes for P\nST\ncompared to P\nSV\n. The P\nDIFF\n, in contrast, decreased up to 11 dB at frequencies between 700 and 800 Hz after reinforcement with bone cement. With bone conduction, the average within-specimen effects were less than 5 dB for either P\nSV\n, P\nST,\nor P\nDIFF\n. The inter-specimen variability with bone conduction, however, was considerably larger than with air conduction. This experimental study shows that RW reinforcement impacts air conduction stimulation at low frequencies. Bone conduction stimulation seems to be largely unaffected. From a clinical point of view, these results support the hypothesis that delayed loss of air conduction hearing after cochlear implantation could be partially explained by the impact of RW reinforcement.\nPMID:\n38850830\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109049",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nSince the presence of tinnitus is not always associated with audiometric hearing loss, it has been hypothesized that hidden hearing loss may act as a potential trigger for increased central gain along the neural pathway leading to tinnitus perception. In recent years, the study of hidden hearing loss has improved with the discovery of cochlear synaptopathy and several objective diagnostic markers. This study investigated three potential markers of peripheral hidden hearing loss in subjects with tinnitus: extended high-frequency audiometric thresholds, the auditory brainstem response, and the envelope following response. In addition, speech intelligibility was measured as a functional outcome measurement of hidden hearing loss. To account for age-related hidden hearing loss, participants were grouped according to age, presence of tinnitus, and audiometric thresholds. Group comparisons were conducted to differentiate between age- and tinnitus-related effects of hidden hearing loss. All three markers revealed age-related differences, whereas no differences were observed between the tinnitus and non-tinnitus groups. However, the older tinnitus group showed improved performance on low-pass filtered speech in noise tests compared to the older non-tinnitus group. These low-pass speech in noise scores were significantly correlated with tinnitus distress, as indicated using questionnaires, and could be related to the presence of hyperacusis. Based on our observations, cochlear synaptopathy does not appear to be the underlying cause of tinnitus. The improvement in low-pass speech-in-noise could be explained by enhanced temporal fine structure encoding or hyperacusis. Therefore, we recommend that future tinnitus research takes into account age-related factors, explores low-frequency encoding, and thoroughly assesses hyperacusis.\nPMID:\n38852534\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109050",

The present investigation delves into the contribution of the Mfsd2a molecule, integral to the structural and functional integrity of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), to the ontogeny and sustenance of the BLB. Our empirical findings delineate that the maturation of the BLB in murine models is not realized until approximately two weeks post-birth, with preceding stages characterized by notable permeability. Transcriptomic analysis elucidates a marked augmentation in Mfsd2a expression within the lateral wall of the cochlea in specimens exhibiting an intact BLB. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo assays substantiate that a diminution in Mfsd2a expression detrimentally impacts BLB permeability and structural integrity, principally via the attenuation of tight junction protein expression and the enhancement of endothelial cell transcytosis. These insights underscore the indispensable role of Mfsd2a in ensuring BLB integrity and propose it as a viable target for therapeutic interventions aimed at the amelioration of hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38852535\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109048",

Using a cross-sectional design, 87 adults with T2DM and 48 non-diabetic controls, all with normal hearing, participated. The two central auditory processing (CAP) skills were assessed through the Gaps-In-Noise (GIN) and Dichotic-Digits Listening (DDL) tests. T2DM participants underwent blood tests to measure various health-related factors. In the GIN test, the shortest gap threshold (GapTh) obtained across both ears was significantly higher in the diabetic group (9.1 ± 2.4 ms) compared to the non-diabetic group (7.5 ± 1.5 ms), and the score of correctly identified gaps (GapSc) in the diabetic group (45±11 %) was significantly lower than GapSc in the non-diabetic group (52±9 %), p < 0.001. In the DDL test, the free-recall score (73.8 ± 18.5 %) across both ears and the right-ear advantage (-1.3 ± 20.6 %) in the diabetic group were significantly lower than the free-recall score (85.8 ± 11.9 %) and right-ear advantage (6.9 ± 11.9 %) in the non-diabetic group, p < 0.005. Furthermore, the duration of diabetes, eGFR level, retinopathy, carotid plaque, fasting blood glucose level, and HDL-C (good cholesterol) level were factors significantly associated with performances in the GIN and/or DDL tests for T2DM participants. In conclusion, individuals with T2DM are at risk of reduced auditory processing skills in temporal resolution and dichotic listening, impacting their speech understanding. Six health-related factors were identified as significantly associated with CAP skills in T2DM patients.\nPMID:\n38870778\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109067",

These demands for rapid adaptation tax the information processing speed ability of children who receive cochlear implants. This study investigated the association of speed of information processing ability with spoken language outcomes after cochlear implantation in prelingually deaf children aged 4-6 years. Two domain-general (visual, non-linguistic) speed of information processing measures were administered to 21 preschool-aged children with cochlear implants and 23 normal-hearing peers. Measures of speech recognition, language (vocabulary and comprehension), nonverbal intelligence, and executive functioning skills were also obtained from each participant. Speed of information processing was positively associated with speech recognition and language skills in preschool-aged children with cochlear implants but not in normal-hearing peers. This association remained significant after controlling for hearing group, age, nonverbal intelligence, and executive functioning skills. These findings are consistent with models suggesting that domain-general, fast-efficient information processing speed underlies adaptation to speech perception and language learning following implantation. Assessment and intervention strategies targeting speed of information processing may provide better understanding and development of speech-language skills after cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38889562\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109069",

However, studies with interaural phase modulation of pure tones showed that IC neurons have a sensitivity to changes in ITD that is not present at the level of the brainstem. This sensitivity has been interpreted as a form of sensitivity to motion. A new type of stimulus is used here to study the sensitivity of IC neurons to dynamic changes in ITD, in which broad- or narrowband stimuli are swept through a range of ITDs with arbitrary start-ITD, end-ITD, speed, and direction. Extracellular recordings were obtained under barbiturate anesthesia in the cat. We applied the same analyses as previously introduced for the study of responses to tones. We find effects of motion which are similar to those described in response to interaural phase modulation of tones. The size of the effects strongly depended on the motion parameters but was overall smaller than reported for tones. We found that the effects of motion could largely be explained by the temporal response pattern of the neuron such as adaptation and build-up. Our data add to previous evidence questioning true coding of motion at the level of the IC.\nPMID:\n38889563\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109066",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nHearing impairment is the most prevalent sensory disease in humans and can have dramatic effects on the development, and preservation, of our cognitive abilities and social interactions. Currently 20 % of the world's population suffer from a form of hearing impairment; this is predicted to rise to 25 % by 2050. Despite this staggering disease load, and the vast damage it inflicts on the social, medical and economic fabric of humankind, our ability to predict, or prevent, the loss of hearing is very poor indeed. We here make the case for a paradigm shift in our approach to studying deafness. By exploiting more forcefully the molecular-genetic conservation between human hearing and hearing in morphologically distinct models, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we believe, a deeper understanding of hearing and deafness can be achieved. An understanding that moves beyond the surface of the 'deafness genes' to probe the underlying bedrock of hearing, which is shared across taxa, and partly shared across modalities. When it comes to understanding the workings (and failings) of human sensory function, a simple fruit fly has a lot to offer and a fly eye might sometimes be a powerful model for a human ear. Particularly the use of fly avatars, in which specific molecular (genetic or proteomic) states of humans (e.g. specific patients) are experimentally reproduced, in order to study the corresponding molecular mechanisms (e.g. specific diseases) in a controlled yet naturalistic environment, is a tool that promises multiple unprecedented insights. The use of the fly - and fly avatars - would benefit humans and will help enhance the power of other scientific models, such as the mouse.\nPMID:\n38896942\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109047",

The clinical evaluation phase involved a prospective single-site clinical study and real-world use across 16 clinics.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: CI clinicians (N = 23), CI recipients in a clinical study (N = 15 adults) and real-world data (N = 57 CI recipients).\nRESULTS: The minimum feature set required for remote programming in RA, combined with sending replacements by post, should enable the clinician to address 80% of the issues typically seen in CI follow-up sessions. Most recipients completed the RA primary tasks without prior training and gave positive ratings for usefulness, ease of use, effectiveness, reliability, and satisfaction on the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire. System latency was reported to be acceptable.\nCONCLUSION: RA is designed to help clinicians address a significant proportion of issues typically encountered by CI recipients. Clinical study and real-world evaluation confirm RA's ease of use, call quality, and responsiveness.\nPMID:\n38696614\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2337075",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVE: Adults typically receive only one cochlear implant (CI) due to cost constraints, with a contralateral hearing aid recommended when there is aidable hearing. Standard hearing aids differ from a CI in terms of processing strategy and function as a separate entity, requiring the user to integrate the disparate signals. Integrated bimodal technology has recently been introduced to address this challenge. The aim of the study was to investigate the performance of unilateral CI users with and without an integrated bimodal fitting and determine whether binaural streaming technology offers additional benefit.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-six CI users using integrated bimodal technology.\nDESIGN: Repeated measures where outcomes and user experience were assessed using a functional test battery more representative of real life listening (speech perception in noise tests, localisation test, tracking test) and the speech, spatial and qualities-of-hearing scale (SSQ).\nRESULTS: Bimodal outcomes were significantly better than for CI alone. Speech perception in noise improvements ranged from 1.4 dB to 3.5 dB depending on the location of speech and noise. The localisation and tracking tests, and the SSQ also showed significant improvements. Binaural streaming offered additional improvement (1.2 dB to 6.1 dB on the different speech tests).\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrated bimodal and binaural streaming technology improved the performance of unilateral CI users.\nPMID:\n38701176\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2341954",

Late peaks were present bilaterally in 78%. The p13-n23 response was present in all patients with SNHL but normal vestibular function, and 43% had late waves. Statistical comparison of these patients to a subset of age-matched controls showed no significant difference in the frequencies, amplitudes or latencies of their ipsilateral early and late peaks. cVEMPs were absent in all patients with vestibular impairment.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of long-latency cVEMP waves was not dependent on the integrity of sensorineural hearing pathways, but instead correlated with intact vestibular function. This finding conflicts with the view that these late waves are cochlear in origin, and suggests that vestibular afferents may assume a more prominent role in their generation.\nPMID:\n38739080\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2341101",

This project examined adults' recollections of discussions with their audiologist to explore (1) how adults report describing their listening difficulties and (2) information that adults report they do not communicate, or do not communicate successfully, to their audiologist.\nDESIGN: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interview transcripts were analysed using a template analysis approach.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen adults who self-report listening difficulties, and who had previously consulted an audiologist.\nRESULTS: Four themes were identified from adults' recollections of how they describe their listening difficulties: (1) situation or context of listening difficulties, (2) behavioural responses, (3) impacts of listening difficulties and (4) contributing factors. Adults report not always successfully communicating (1) emotional concerns and impacts, (2) descriptions of sound quality and (3) descriptions of changed listening experiences.\nCONCLUSION: Results provide insights about the times when adults feel that communication with their audiologist is successful, or unsuccessful. The results are useful for informing interventions to help adults and audiologists communicate more effectively together. To further inform interventions, factors affecting adults' communication should be explored.\nPMID:\n38739207\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2351033",

Differences in reference equivalent threshold vibratory force levels were estimated by comparing hearing threshold measurements of 60 healthy ears using B81 and B250.\nRESULTS: B250 has approximately 27 dB higher sensitivity levels than both B71 and B81 at 250 Hz and can generate higher maximum hearing level at low frequencies: 11.8 to 35.8 dB (125-1000 Hz) higher than B71, and 1.4 to 18.6 dB (125-750 Hz) higher than B81. The maximum average difference in reference threshold force levels was 13.5 ± 8.7 dB higher for B250 at 250 Hz compared to B81.\nCONCLUSIONS: B250 can produce higher output force with less distortion than B71 and B81, especially at 125 and 250 Hz, which could possibly improve low frequency investigations of the audio-vestibular system.\nPMID:\n38742487\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2352054",

The data were analysed in line with the constant comparative approach of grounded theory. A substantial patient and public engagement (PPIE) strategy underpinned decisions and processes throughout.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Adults were recruited from age bands (16-29; 30-49;50-79 and 80 upwards) to provide different lived experience. We recruited individuals from across the UK including urban, sub-urban and rural communities and included a typical constituency of each location including black and minority ethnic participants. Our PPIE groups included adults often marginalised in research including South Asian community groups, adults in residential care and those with additional disabilities.\nRESULTS: We identified the consistent features of the lived experience with hearing loss, as the individualised responsibility that hearing loss confers.

Predictive speech intelligibility modelling using the Hearing-Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) was also performed on recordings of HA processed test material.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Twenty adults with sensory hearing loss and 10 adults with normal hearing participated.\nRESULTS: Speech recognition for participants with hearing loss improved significantly when using the RM compared to HAs alone fit to Phonak's proprietary prescription. Largest benefits were observed in the most challenging conditions. At the lowest signal-to-noise ratio, participants with hearing loss using a RM outperformed normal hearing listeners. Predicted intelligibility scores produced by HASPI were strongly correlated to behavioural results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adults using HAs who have significant difficulties understanding speech in noise will experience considerable benefits with the addition of a RM.

To also investigate the effects of three otologic history factors.\nDESIGN: Using headphone presentation, speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured with simple sentences. As maskers, stationary speech-shaped noise (SSN) or two-talker running speech (TTS) were used. The stimuli were presented in a monaural and binaural condition (SSN) or a co-located and spatially separated condition (TTS). Based on the available medical records, overall OM duration, OM onset age, and time since the last OM episode were estimated.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 6-13-year-olds with a history of recurrent OM (\nN\n= 42) or without any ear diseases (\nN\n= 20) with normal tympanograms and audiograms at the time of testing.\nRESULTS: Mixed-model regression analyses that controlled for age showed poorer SRTs for the OM group (Δ-value = 0.84 dB,\np\n= 0.009). These appeared driven by the spatially separated, binaural, and monaural conditions. The OM group showed large inter-individual differences, which were unrelated to the otologic history factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early-childhood OM can affect speech recognition in different acoustic conditions. The effects of the otologic history warrant further investigation.\nPMID:\n38767554\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2348506",

Extremely large earcanals (12.7% of earcanals in our sample) lead to significantly lower earplug attenuation (potentially inadequate) than smaller earcanals.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EE is a simple and inexpensive tool easily deployable in the field to assist earplugs selection. When extended with sizes larger than the maximum size of the commercial tool, it allows for detecting individuals with extremely large earcanals who are most likely to be under-protected.\nPMID:\n38804563\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2352045",

Two themes were identified, specifically: (1) an association between HL and hearing aids and the stereotypes of ageing, disability, and difference; and (2) varied views on the existence and experience of stigma for adults with HL. Hearing care professionals focused on the stigma of hearing aids more than HL, whereas adult participants focused on stigma of HL. Family member data indicated that they experienced little affiliate stigma.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stigma-induced identity threat related to HL and, to a lesser extent, hearing aids exists for adults with HL.

Existing interventions lack effectiveness and are typically not based on a theoretically driven, comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing infant hearing aid use. The present study is the first to address this gap in understanding.\nDESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: A 55-item online survey based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was completed by 56 parents of 0-3-year-old hearing aid users.\nRESULTS: Participants reported a wide range of barriers across TDF domains, which were associated with parent-reported hearing aid use and more pronounced in parents of lower hearing aid users. The most strongly reported domains across participants were \"emotion\" (e.g. feelings of worry when using hearing aids), \"beliefs about capabilities\" (e.g. belief in ability to use hearing aids consistently), and \"environmental context and resources\" (e.g. child removing hearing aids).\nCONCLUSIONS: Parents report a wider range of barriers to infant hearing aid use than existing investigations suggest and current interventions address.

With current technology, most CI users obtain very good speech understanding in quiet listening environments. However, many CI users still struggle when listening to music. Efforts have been made to preprocess music for CI users and improve their music enjoyment. This work investigates potential modifications of instrumental music to make it more accessible for CI users. For this purpose, we used two datasets with varying complexity and containing individual tracks of instrumental music. The first dataset contained trios and it was newly created and synthesized for this study. The second dataset contained orchestral music with a large number of instruments. Bilateral CI users and normal hearing listeners were asked to remix the multitracks grouped into melody, bass, accompaniment, and percussion. Remixes could be performed in the amplitude, spatial, and spectral domains. Results showed that CI users preferred tracks being panned toward the right side, especially the percussion component. When CI users were grouped into frequent or occasional music listeners, significant differences in remixing preferences in all domains were observed.\nPMID:\n38613359\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241245219",

However, wearing hearing devices can also have negative effects on perception, previously demonstrated mostly for spatial hearing, sound quality and the perception of the own voice. When hearing devices are set to transparency, that is, provide no gain and resemble open-ear listening as well as possible, these side effects can be studied in isolation. In the present work, we conducted a series of experiments that are concerned with the effect of transparent hearing devices on speech perception in a collocated speech-in-noise task. In such a situation, listening through a hearing device is not expected to have any negative effect, since both speech and noise undergo identical processing, such that the signal-to-noise ratio at ear is not altered and spatial effects are irrelevant. However, we found a consistent hearing device disadvantage for speech intelligibility and similar trends for rated listening effort. Several hypotheses for the possible origin for this disadvantage were tested by including several different devices, gain settings and stimulus levels. While effects of self-noise and nonlinear distortions were ruled out, the exact reason for a hearing device disadvantage on speech perception is still unclear. However, a significant relation to auditory model predictions demonstrate that the speech intelligibility disadvantage is related to sound quality, and is most probably caused by insufficient equalization, artifacts of frequency-dependent signal processing and processing delays.\nPMID:\n38629486\n| PMC:\nPMC11025430\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246597",

For hearing care, this means that hearing aid benefits can potentially be overshadowed by adverse experiences. Research has shown that sustaining focus on positive experiences has the potential to mitigate negativity bias. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether a positive focus (PF) intervention can improve speech-in-noise abilities for experienced hearing aid users. Thirty participants were randomly allocated to a control or PF group (N = 2 × 15). Prior to hearing aid fitting, all participants filled out the short form of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale (SSQ12) based on their own hearing aids. At the first visit, they were fitted with study hearing aids, and speech-in-noise testing was performed. Both groups then wore the study hearing aids for two weeks and sent daily text messages reporting hours of hearing aid use to an experimenter. In addition, the PF group was instructed to focus on positive listening experiences and to also report them in the daily text messages. After the 2-week trial, all participants filled out the SSQ12 questionnaire based on the study hearing aids and completed the speech-in-noise testing again. Speech-in-noise performance and SSQ12 Qualities score were improved for the PF group but not for the control group.

Literature suggests that listening effort measures may be more sensitive to differences between hearing-device settings than established speech intelligibility measures when speech intelligibility is near maximum. Which method provides the most effective measurement of listening effort for this purpose is currently unclear. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of two tests for measuring changes in listening effort in CI users due to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) differences, as would arise from different hearing-device settings. By comparing the effect size of SNR differences on listening effort measures with test-retest differences, the study evaluated the suitability of these tests for clinical use. Nineteen CI users underwent two listening effort tests at two SNRs (+4 and +8 dB relative to individuals' 50% speech perception threshold). We employed dual-task paradigms-a sentence-final word identification and recall test (SWIRT) and a sentence verification test (SVT)-to assess listening effort at these two SNRs. Our results show a significant difference in listening effort between the SNRs for both test methods, although the effect size was comparable to the test-retest difference, and the sensitivity was not superior to speech intelligibility measures. Thus, the implementations of SVT and SWIRT used in this study are not suitable for clinical use to measure listening effort differences of this magnitude in individual CI users. However, they can be used in research involving CI users to analyze group data.\nPMID:\n38676325\n| PMC:\nPMC11055488\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241240572",

The study recruited 81 older adult hearing aid users between 60 and 95 years of age with bilateral moderate to severe hearing loss. The Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic (MoCA-BC) was used to screen older adults for mild cognitive impairment. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured using 2- to 5-digit sequences of the Mandarin iDIN. The differences in SRT between five-digit and two-digit sequences (SRT\n5-2\n), and between five-digit and three-digit sequences (SRT\n5-3\n), were used as indicators of memory performance. The results were compared to those from the Digit Span Test and Corsi Blocks Tapping Test, which evaluate WM and attention capacity. SRT\n5-2\nand SRT\n5-3\ndemonstrated significant correlations with the three cognitive function tests (\nr\ns ranging from -.705 to -.528). Furthermore, SRT\n5-2\nand SRT\n5-3\nwere significantly higher in participants who failed the MoCA-BC screening compared to those who passed. The findings show associations between performance on the iDIN and performance on memory tests.

A link with the degree of postoperative hearing preservation in patients was investigated, but patient populations were usually small. Therefore, this study's aim was to analyze data from intraoperative extracochlear electrocochleography (ECochG) recordings for a larger group.During hearing preservation CI surgery, extracochlear recordings were made before, during, and after CI electrode insertion using a cotton wick electrode placed at the promontory. Before and after insertion, amplitudes and stimulus response thresholds were recorded at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz. During insertion, response amplitudes were recorded at one frequency and one stimulus level. Data from 121 patient ears were analyzed.The key benefit of extracochlear recordings is that they can be performed before, during, and after CI electrode insertion. However, extracochlear ECochG threshold changes before and after CI insertion were relatively small and did not independently correlate well with hearing preservation, although at 250 Hz they added some significant information. Some tendencies-although no significant relationships-were detected between amplitude behavior and hearing preservation. Rising amplitudes seem favorable and falling amplitudes disadvantageous, but constant amplitudes do not appear to allow stringent predictions.Extracochlear ECochG measurements seem to only partially realize expected benefits. The questions now are: do gains justify the effort, and do other procedures or possible combinations lead to greater benefits for patients?\nPMID:\n38715410\n| PMC:\nPMC11080760\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241252240",

A promising method is electrocochleography (ECochG). Within this project the relations between intracochlear ECochG recordings, position of the recording contact in the cochlea with respect to anatomy and frequency and preservation of residual hearing were investigated. The aim was to better understand the changes in ECochG signals and whether these are due to the electrode position in the cochlea or to trauma generated during insertion. During and after insertion of hearing preservation electrodes, intraoperative ECochG recordings were performed using the CI electrode (MED-EL). During insertion, the recordings were performed at discrete insertion steps on electrode contact 1. After insertion as well as postoperatively the recordings were performed at different electrode contacts. The electrode location in the cochlea during insertion was estimated by mathematical models using preoperative clinical imaging, the postoperative location was measured using postoperative clinical imaging. The recordings were analyzed from six adult CI recipients. In the four patients with good residual hearing in the low frequencies the signal amplitude rose with largest amplitudes being recorded closest to the generators of the stimulation frequency, while in both cases with severe pantonal hearing losses the amplitude initially rose and then dropped. This might be due to various reasons as discussed in the following. Our results indicate that this approach can provide valuable information for the interpretation of intracochlearly recorded ECochG signals.\nPMID:\n38717441\n| PMC:\nPMC11080744\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241248973",

A total of 4,589 SM undergoing annual audiometric surveillance were prospectively recruited to complete the THS tinnitus subscale (THS-T). A subset of 1,304 participants also completed the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). The original 5-point response scale of the THS (THS-T\n16\n) was modified to an 11-point scale (THS-T\n40\n) for some participants, to align with the response scale of the TFI. Age, sex, hearing loss, and self-reported tinnitus bother were also recorded. The THS-T was relatively insensitive to hearing, but self-reported bothersome tinnitus was significantly associated with the THS-T\n40\nscore. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine cutoff scores on the THS-T that aligned with recommended cutoff values for clinical intervention on the TFI.

Both age and noise exposure contribute to synaptopathy in animal models, indicating that it may be a common type of auditory dysfunction in humans. Temporal bone and auditory physiological data suggest that age and occupational/military noise exposure also lead to synaptopathy in humans. The predicted perceptual consequences of synaptopathy include tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. However, confirming the perceptual impacts of this form of cochlear deafferentation presents a particular challenge because synaptopathy can only be confirmed through post-mortem temporal bone analysis and auditory perception is difficult to evaluate in animals. Animal data suggest that deafferentation leads to increased central gain, signs of tinnitus and abnormal loudness perception, and deficits in temporal processing and signal-in-noise detection. If equivalent changes occur in humans following deafferentation, this would be expected to increase the likelihood of developing tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. Physiological data from humans is consistent with the hypothesis that deafferentation is associated with increased central gain and a greater likelihood of tinnitus perception, while human data on the relationship between deafferentation and hyperacusis is extremely limited. Many human studies have investigated the relationship between physiological correlates of deafferentation and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception, with mixed findings. A non-linear relationship between deafferentation and speech perception may have contributed to the mixed results. When differences in sample characteristics and study measurements are considered, the findings may be more consistent.\nPMID:\n38738337\n| PMC:\nPMC11092548\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241239541",

Progressing beyond these unnatural stimuli, brainstem responses to continuous speech presented via earphones have been recently detected using linear temporal response functions (TRFs). Here, we extend earlier studies by measuring subcortical responses to continuous speech presented in the sound-field, and assess the amount of data needed to estimate brainstem TRFs. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 24 normal hearing participants while they listened to clicks and stories presented via earphones and loudspeakers. Subcortical TRFs were computed after accounting for non-linear processing in the auditory periphery by either stimulus rectification or an auditory nerve model. Our results demonstrated that subcortical responses to continuous speech could be reliably measured in the sound-field. TRFs estimated using auditory nerve models outperformed simple rectification, and 16 minutes of data was sufficient for the TRFs of all participants to show clear wave V peaks for both earphones and sound-field stimuli. Subcortical TRFs to continuous speech were highly consistent in both earphone and sound-field conditions, and with click ABRs. However, sound-field TRFs required slightly more data (16 minutes) to achieve clear wave V peaks compared to earphone TRFs (12 minutes), possibly due to effects of room acoustics. By investigating subcortical responses to sound-field speech stimuli, this study lays the groundwork for bringing objective hearing assessment closer to real-life conditions, which may lead to improved hearing evaluations and smart hearing technologies.\nPMID:\n38738341\n| PMC:\nPMC11092544\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246596",

The data were retrieved from a total of 52 children with MBHL and 30 children with normal hearing (NH). The association between demographical, audiological factors and language outcomes was examined. Analyses of variance were conducted to compare the language abilities of HA users, non-HA users, and their NH peers. Furthermore, regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of language outcomes. Aided better ear pure-tone average (BEPTA) was significantly correlated with language comprehension scores. Among children with MBHL, those who used HA outperformed the ones who did not use HA across all linguistic domains. The language skills of children with MBHL were comparable to those of their peers with NH. The degree of improvement in audibility in terms of aided BEPTA was a significant predictor of language comprehension. It is noteworthy that 50% of the parents expressed reluctance regarding HA use for their children with MBHL. The findings highlight the positive impact of HA usage on language development in this population. Professionals may therefore consider HAs as a viable treatment option for children with MBHL, especially when there is a potential risk of language delay due to hearing loss. It was observed that 25% of the children with MBHL had late-onset hearing loss.

One possible source of benefit is ANC's ability to reduce the sound level of the direct (i.e., vent-transmitted) path. This reduction lowers the \"floor\" imposed by the direct path, thereby allowing any increases to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) created in the amplified path to be \"realized\" at the eardrum. Here we used a modeling approach to estimate this benefit. We compared pairs of simulated hearing aids that differ only in terms of their ability to provide ANC and computed intelligibility metrics on their outputs. The difference in metric scores between simulated devices is termed the \"ANC Benefit.\" These simulations show that ANC Benefit increases as (1) the environmental sound level increases, (2) the ability of the hearing aid to improve SNR increases, (3) the strength of the ANC increases, and (4) the hearing loss severity decreases. The predicted size of the ANC Benefit can be substantial. For a moderate hearing loss, the model predicts improvement in intelligibility metrics of >30% when environments are moderately loud (>70 dB SPL) and devices are moderately capable of increasing SNR (by >4 dB). It appears that ANC can be a critical ingredient in hearing devices that attempt to improve SNR in loud environments. ANC will become more and more important as advanced SNR-improving algorithms (e.g., artificial intelligence speech enhancement) are included in hearing devices.\nPMID:\n38831646\n| PMC:\nPMC11149449\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260029",

However, its validity has been a subject of debate, as previous studies noted differences between hearing thresholds measured using conventional and in-situ audiometry. The differences were particularly notable for open-fit hearing aids, attributed to low-frequency leakage caused by the vent. Here, in-situ audiometry was investigated for six receiver-in-canal hearing aids from different manufacturers through three experiments. In Experiment I, the hearing aid gain was measured to investigate whether corrections were implemented to the prescribed target gain. In Experiment II, the in-situ stimuli were recorded to investigate if corrections were directly incorporated to the delivered in-situ stimulus. Finally, in Experiment III, hearing thresholds using in-situ and conventional audiometry were measured with real patients wearing open-fit hearing aids. Results indicated that (1) the hearing aid gain remained unaffected when measured with in-situ or conventional audiometry for all open-fit measurements, (2) the in-situ stimuli were adjusted for up to 30 dB at frequencies below 1000 Hz for all open-fit hearing aids except one, which also recommends the use of closed domes for all in-situ measurements, and (3) the mean interparticipant threshold difference fell within 5 dB for frequencies between 250 and 6000 Hz. The results clearly indicated that modern measured in-situ thresholds align (within 5 dB) with conventional thresholds measured, indicating the potential of in-situ audiometry for remote hearing care.\nPMID:\n38835268\n| PMC:\nPMC11155351\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241259704",

For almost as many years, clinicians and researchers have sought ways to distill the volume and complexity of information on the audiogram. Commonly used approaches have made use of pure-tone averages (PTAs) for various frequency ranges with the PTA for 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (PTA4) being the most widely used for the categorization of hearing loss severity. Here, a three-digit triad is proposed as a single-number summary of not only the severity, but also the configuration and bilateral symmetry of the hearing loss. Each digit in the triad ranges from 0 to 9, increasing as the level of the pure-tone hearing threshold level (HTL) increases from a range of optimal hearing (< 10 dB Hearing Level; HL) to complete hearing loss (≥ 90 dB HL). Each digit also represents a different frequency region of the audiogram proceeding from left to right as: (Low, L) PTA for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz; (Center, C) PTA for 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz; and (High, H) HTL at 8000 Hz. This LCH Triad audiogram-classification system is evaluated using a large United States (U.S.) national dataset (N = 8,795) from adults 20 to 80 + years of age and two large clinical datasets totaling 8,254 adults covering a similar age range. Its ability to capture variations in hearing function was found to be superior to that of the widely used PTA4.\nPMID:\n38870447\n| PMC:\nPMC11179497\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260041",

This study aimed to identify changing trends in distributions of hearing threshold levels across ages by comparing the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7029 and newly available data after publishing ISO 7029. To compare ISO 7029 and newly available hearing threshold data after publishing ISO 7029, four country-specific datasets that presented average hearing threshold levels under conditions similar to ISO 7029 were utilized. For frequencies between 125 Hz and 8,000 Hz, the deviations of hearing threshold values by ages from the hearing threshold of the youngest age group for each data point were utilized. For frequencies from 9,000 Hz to 12,500 Hz, the median threshold information was utilized. Hearing threshold data reported after publishing ISO 7029 from the four countries were mostly similar to the ISO 7029 data but tended to deviate in some age groups and sexes. As national hearing threshold trends change, the following ISO 7029 revision suggests the need to integrate hearing threshold data from different countries.\nPMID:\n38254303\n| PMC:\nPMC10808389\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00626",

Systemic steroids are often used as the first-line treatment because they reduce inner ear inflammation; however, there remains numerous discussions about the effectiveness of alternative treatments. To predict hearing recovery is crucial in patients' counseling with factors, including delayed treatment, vertigo, and other health conditions, which indicate poor prognosis.

A 52-year-old male patient with intractable vertigo or single-sided deafness should raise suspicion of this clinical entity as a differential diagnosis. Translabyrinthine excision of the tumor along with auditory rehabilitation using a cochlear implant can provide good outcomes with minimal morbidity in carefully selected cases.

However, whether musicianship provides an advantage for the listening effort (LE) required to comprehend speech in degraded environments has received less attention. The current study aimed to understand the influence of Indian classical music training on SIN perception and its related LE across percussionists, non-percussionists, and non-musicians.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: A quasi-experiment was conducted on 16 percussionists, 17 non-percussionists, and 26 non-musicians aged 18-35 years with normal hearing. In phase 1, musical abilities were assessed using Mini-Profile of Music Perception Skills (Mini-PROMS). Phase 2 examined SIN using Tamil Phonemically-Balanced Words and Tamil Matrix Sentence Test at +5 dB, 0 dB, and -5 dB SNR and LE using pupillometry, measuring pupil dilations with an eye-tracker.\nRESULTS: Fractional Logit and Linear Regression models demonstrated that percussionists outperformed non-percussionists in Tuning and Speed subsets of Mini-PROMS. Percussionists outperformed non-percussionists and non-musicians in SIN and LE at -5 dB SNR for words and at 0 dB and -5 dB SNR for sentences.\nCONCLUSIONS: Percussionists have the greatest advantage in decoding SIN with reduced LE followed by non-percussionists and non-musicians, demonstrating musician-advantage in most challenging listening conditions.\nPMID:\n38382518\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00248",

Epub 2024 Feb 22.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are low-intensity sounds generated by the cochlea and associated with the function of the outer hair cells. Since OAE measurements do not require active participation of a listener, OAEs are considered an objective measure of cochlear function. While distortion-product OAEs (DPOAEs) are commonly used in clinical practice, limited information is available on the performance of various clinical devices. This study compared two commercial clinical devices, Titan and Eclipse from Interacoustics, and collected normative data for DPOAEs in people with normal hearing. The data collection and analysis were focused on signal and noise amplitudes as well as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three participants with normal hearing (age 23.2±2.0 years) were included in the study. DPOAEs were measured at 31 frequencies ranging from 500 to 10,000 Hz.\nRESULTS: DPOAE amplitude differed across frequencies. Additionally, a high number of unreliable responses were observed at the edge frequencies (<828 Hz and >6,072 Hz). There were no significant differences between the two devices in terms of DPOAE amplitudes, but the recorded-noise levels (amplitude) differed significantly. SNRs of the recorded OAEs were frequency dependent (higher frequencies showed larger SNRs), and significant differences in terms of SNR were found between the two devices.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the above-mentioned differences, the OAEs recorded with both devices met the pass criteria for the SNR (≥6 dB) consistently across frequencies, and thus the differences do not compromise the test outcomes. The frequency dependence of the OAE amplitudes and the corresponding SNRs may be relevant for clinical practice.\nPMID:\n38382519\n| PMC:\nPMC11065547\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00269",

Among the side effects of these drugs, alterations associated with the auditory system are frequently mentioned. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to systematically review publications on hearing disorders and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were observational or interventional studies on audiological assessment in participants who were using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Meta-Analysis of Statistics: assessment and review Instrument. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,372 non-duplicate papers were screened, out of which 17 were included in the final qualitative synthesis, and 5 studies in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio for the two subgroups evaluated did not show significance with no heterogeneity between the effects observed between the different diseases (I2=0%) and obtaining the global estimate of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.41-1.39; p>0.05). Despite the inclusion of papers with different disease samples, the heterogeneity observed in the analysis was low (I2= 0%) and prediction interval (95% PI=0.32-1.80; p>0.05) remained close to that estimated by the CI (95% CI=0.41-1.39; p>0.05). The certainty of the evidence assessed by the GRADE tool was considered very low due to the risk of bias, indirect evidence, and imprecision.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is not associated with hearing disorders.\nPMID:\n38382520\n| PMC:\nPMC11065553\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00157",

The meter, representing a well-organized sequence of evenly spaced beats in music, exhibits a hierarchical arrangement, with stronger beats occupying higher metrical positions. Moreover, the meter has been shown to influence behavioral and neural processing, particularly the N1, P2, and mismatch negativity components. However, the role of the P1 component in the context of metrical hierarchy remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component and compare the responses between musicians and non-musicians.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Thirty participants (15 musicians and 15 non-musicians) were enrolled in the study. Auditory stimuli consisted of a synthesized speech syllable presented together with a repeating series of four tones, establishing a quadruple meter. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to measure the P1 component.\nRESULTS: : The results revealed that metrical position had a significant effect on P1 amplitude, with the strongest beat showing the lowest amplitude. This contrasts with previous findings, in which enhanced P1 responses were typically observed at on-the-beat positions. The reduced P1 response on the strong beat can be interpreted within the framework of predictive coding and temporal prediction, where a higher predictability of pitch changes at the strong beat leads to a reduction in the P1 response. Furthermore, higher P1 amplitudes were observed in musicians compared to non-musicians, suggesting that musicians have enhanced sensory processing.\nCONCLUSIONS: : This study demonstrates the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component, thereby enriching our understanding of auditory processing. The results suggest that predictive coding and temporal prediction play important roles in shaping sensory processing. Further, they suggest that musical training may enhance P1 responses.\nPMID:\n38685834\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00262",

When evaluating young children for cochlear implantation, there are unique considerations beyond the standard issues addressed during surgery in adults. Because of advances in genetic testing, imaging resolution, CI technology, post-implant rehabilitation, and other factors, issues related to CI surgery in children continue to evolve. Such factors have led to changes in candidacy guidelines, vaccine requirements, and lowering of age requirement for surgery. In addition, differences in the anatomy and physiology of infants require special attention to ensure safety when operating on young children. This review summarizes these issues and provides guidance for surgeons treating children with SNHL.\nPMID:\n38695052\n| PMC:\nPMC11065545\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00073",

Considering the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of SNHL, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized knowledge on its genomic architecture. Nonetheless, the conventional application of panel and exome sequencing in real-world practice is being challenged by the emerging need to explore the diagnostic capability of whole-genome sequencing, which enables the detection of both noncoding and structural variations. Small molecules and gene therapies represent good examples of how breakthroughs in genetic understanding can be translated into targeted therapies for SNHL. For example, targeted small molecules have been used to ameliorate autoinflammatory hearing loss caused by gain-of-function variants of NLRP3 and inner ear proteinopathy with OSBPL2 variants underlying dysfunctional autophagy. Strikingly, the successful outcomes of the first-in-human trial of OTOF gene therapy highlighted its potential in the treatment of various forms of genetic hearing loss. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies are currently being developed for site-specific genome editing to treat human genetic disorders.

Epub 2024 Apr 10.\nABSTRACT\nWe herein review the use of electrocochleography (ECoG) to assess peripheral auditory system responsiveness in a growing population of cochlear implant (CI) users with preserved hearing in ears with implants. Twenty-eight recently published intracochlear ECoG articles were thoroughly reviewed to investigate the prognostic utility of intraoperative ECoG monitoring to assess hearing preservation, and the clinical applicability of postoperative ECoG for estimating audiometric thresholds and monitoring longitudinal changes in residual acoustic hearing in patients with EAS. Intraoperative ECoG studies have focused on monitoring the changes in the cochlear microphonics (CM) amplitudes during and after electrode insertion. Mixed results have been reported regarding the relationship between changes in CM amplitude in the operating room and changes in hearing thresholds after surgery. Postoperative ECoG studies have shown that CM and auditory nerve neurophonics thresholds correlate significantly with behavioral thresholds. ECoG thresholds sensitively detect changes as residual acoustic hearing decreases over time in some CI users. This indicates its potential clinical value for monitoring the post-implantation status of the peripheral auditory system. Intracochlear ECoG can provide real-time intraoperative feedback and monitor postoperative hearing preservation in a growing population of CI users.\nPMID:\n38695055\n| PMC:\nPMC11065546\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00129",

Epub 2024 Apr 10.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Additional needs refer to specific requirements or support for individuals with disabilities or syndromes. Intellectual ability is a crucial outcome determinant of a cochlear implant. The social quotient (SQ) is an indirect predictor of intellectual capacity and social skills. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of the SQ on children with additional needs who received cochlear implants. Subjects and.\nMETHODS: This study included 24 patients with diagnosed developmental delays and syndromes, who demonstrated SQ scores of <70. Preoperative social skills were evaluated using the SQ. All patients underwent cochlear implantation (CI) surgery before 7 years of age. Outcomes were evaluated using the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) and Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) scores. Data were collected through a retrospective chart review.\nRESULTS: Children were categorized into three groups based on their SQ. There were no correlations between the preoperative SQ and IT-MAIS or CAP scores at 2 and 5 years of follow-up postoperatively. The CI outcomes of children with low SQ (<70) differed from those with normal development (SQ>70). In the low-SQ group, inner ear anomalies were observed in 10 (41.7%) patients. Although not statistically significant, these children exhibited a trend of lower average outcomes than children without inner ear anomalies.\nCONCLUSIONS: CI outcomes in children with additional needs positively affected auditory performance. Postoperative auditory and language skills tended to improve slowly in children with additional needs and a lower SQ. Over time, development gradually became more comparable to the other groups of children. However, this improvement was less than that observed in children without additional needs. Our findings support CI for children with additional needs as part of long-term auditory rehabilitation following surgery.\nPMID:\n38695056\n| PMC:\nPMC11065552\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00101",

Integrating interprofessional education experiences into graduate communication sciences and disorders (CSD) programs is essential to cultivate collaborative skills and prepare future professionals for the interprofessional demands of the field. Within this context, peer teaching has emerged as a noteworthy strategy to promote learning. This study aims to contribute to this evolving field by reporting the impact of an interprofessional (speech-language pathology and audiology) peer teaching educational intervention on physician assistant (PA) students' knowledge of speech-language-hearing developmental milestones and developmental screening.\nMETHOD: A quantitative, descriptive methodology with a pretest, posttest interventional design was utilized to assess the impact of a CSD peer-led educational intervention on the knowledge of 35 PA students. The perceived satisfaction of the PA students with the peer-led educational experience was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Data analysis revealed a significant increase on knowledge posttest scores compared to pretest scores. PA students also reported an overall positive peer learning experience.\nCONCLUSION: The collaboration between speech-language pathology, audiology, and PA students through peer teaching holds significant importance in the context of pediatric primary care, and for CSD graduate trainings programs interested in improving educational experiences that tailor to interprofessional learning and practice.\nPMID:\n38748920\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00273",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Bone conduction hearing devices (BCDs) that deliver sound across the skin (i.e., transcutaneous) are suitable for some individuals who have conductive or mixed hearing losses. Prescriptive targets for percutaneous devices are available, for example, from the Desired Sensation Level-Bone Conduction Hearing Device (DSL-BCD) algorithm. These targets, however, may require modification for use with transcutaneous BCDs. The current study investigated three key variables that may inform target modification: (a) comparison of thresholds measured using an audiometric bone conduction (BC) transducer versus transcutaneous BCDs that offer in situ threshold measurement, (b) transcutaneous BCD default force level outputs versus recommended DSL percutaneous BC targets, and (c) the preferred listening levels (PLLs) of adults wearing transcutaneous BCDs in a laboratory setting.\nMETHOD: Bilateral conductive hearing loss was simulated in 20 normal-hearing adults via earplugs. Thresholds were measured using a B-71 BC transducer and two commercially available BCDs coupled to a soft headband. DSL percutaneous BC targets were generated, and PLLs were obtained for a 60-dB SPL speech stimulus. Force level outputs were measured using a skull simulator on the Audioscan Verifit2 at the hearing aids' default settings and at the participants' PLL for each device.\nRESULTS: On average, audiometric BC thresholds were significantly better than those measured in situ with each BCD. PLLs were similar to prescribed targets for one device with the smoother response shape and agreed in the high frequencies for both devices.\nCONCLUSIONS: In situ thresholds are significantly higher than audiometric BC thresholds, suggesting that device-based in situ measurement more accurately accounts for the signal transmission from transcutaneous BCDs. PLLs differed from the percutaneous targets and varied between devices, which may indicate that either target modifications or manipulations of device frequency response shaping are needed to approximate PLL with transcutaneous BCD devices.\nPMID:\n38748932\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00258",

In this study, we measured the association of drive times to the nearest audiologist with population density, income, ethnicity, race, and distance to the nearest audiology graduate program.\nMETHOD: Drive times for each census block group to the nearest audiologist were measured using census data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and a geographic analyzing tool called ArcGIS for all block groups within the United States. The association between drive times and population density, income, ethnicity, race, and audiology program distance was evaluated with a population density-matched case-control study and multiple linear regression analyses.\nRESULTS: Approximately 5.29 million Americans need to drive at least 1 hr to visit their closest audiologist. The 10% most rural-dwelling Americans drive an average of 33.8 min. The population density-matched case-control study demonstrated that percent below poverty, percent identifying as Hispanic, and travel times to the nearest audiology program were all significantly higher in census block groups with high drive times to the nearest audiologist. An average of 7.96% of individuals in census block groups with low drive times identified as Hispanic, but 18.8% identified as Hispanic in high drive time groups. The multiple linear regression showed that the effect of demographics and distance to the nearest audiology program was highest in rural areas. In both analyses, adjusting for poverty did not drastically change the effect of percent identifying as Hispanic on drive times.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long drive times restrict access to audiological care for those who live in rural areas.

Patients who were referred to the Speech and Hearing Centers located in Hengelo and Zwolle in the Netherlands and aged ≥ 18 years with hyperacusis as main complaint and no or mild hearing loss were included in this study. Patients were seen for CSET between June 2020 and August 2022. The sessions took place biweekly. Sessions ended when exposure reached a level with a maximum of 70-80 dB SPL. Short-term effects between the start and the end of therapy were based on tolerable level of sound exposure (dB SPL), subjective-level hinderance of hyperacusis, and sensitivity to sound using the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). The long-term effect was based on HQ 6 months after the end of therapy. Linear mixed-effects and regression models were applied to study outcomes over time.\nRESULTS: In total, 30 patients, 15 men and 15 women, aged between 24 and 76 years were included in this study. The mean number of sessions during therapy was 6 and ranged between 4 and 8. Results showed an increase of exposure level (mean change was +23.7 dB with an\nSD\nof 7.9,\np\n< .001), a decrease in sensitivity to daily sounds (mean [\nSD\n] change was -1.6 [2.1],\np\n< .001), and a decrease in HQ (mean [\nSD\n] change was -9.8 [4.9],\np\n< .001), between the start and the end of therapy. There was no significant change in HQ after the end of therapy and 6 months later; mean (\nSD\n) change was 0.2 (4.3),\np\n= .81.\nCONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of CSET indicated a decrease in short- and long-term sensitivity to sound in patients with hyperacusis. Additionally, CSET has shown a positive impact, not only for the sounds used in the therapy sessions but also in transferring benefits to everyday sounds. The results of combining psychoeducation, sound exposure, and counseling are promising and warrant further evaluation.\nPMID:\n38768075\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00210",

Understanding the hearing aid needs of individuals with hearing loss is important to support uptake, use, and outcomes. The current study describes users' perspectives on how hearing aids can be improved.\nMETHOD: A cross-sectional, qualitative, content analysis design was used for an open-ended question from an online survey, exploring user perspectives on hearing aid improvements. Participants were adult hearing aid users in the United States, surveyed from the HearingTracker and Lexie Hearing user database.\nRESULTS: A total of 628 participants (\nM\nage\n= 66 years) were surveyed. The majority of participants used bilateral, behind-the-ear hearing aids that were obtained either through a hearing health care professional or online. Three domains, highlighting areas for hearing aid improvement, were identified. (a) The hearing aid features domain described user issues surrounding physical appearance and fit, general features, streaming, battery functionality, adjustments, smartphone applications, and hearing aid-related accessories. There was dissatisfaction with aesthetics and functionality, with a notable desire for improvements in physical appearance and fit (\nn\n= 161), and features to improve self-efficacy. (b) The sound quality domain described user issues surrounding sound perception and difficult situations. Participants highlighted unmet needs for clarity, especially in noisy environments (\nn\n= 143). (c) The service-delivery domain described user issues surrounding audiology services and general satisfaction, with criticisms centered on the high cost of hearing aids (\nn\n= 193) and the credibility of hearing health care professionals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hearing aid users appreciated current technological advances but expressed a need for improvements, to better align devices with their requirements. Key areas included physical aesthetics, user control over device adjustments, sound clarity, cost accessibility, and trust between the user and hearing health care professional. Future designs should focus on features enhancing user autonomy and self-efficacy.\nPMID:\n38768085\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00245",

The objective of these analyses was to compare AP between those with and without a clinical diagnosis of MCI using a battery of AP measures.\nMETHOD: Data from 274 older adults from the Keys to Staying Sharp randomized clinical trial (NCT03528486) were analyzed. A battery of AP measures in which three domains (temporal processing, binaural processing, and degraded speech understanding) were addressed by six tests was administered. Analyses were registered at https://osf.io/nga4v.\nRESULTS: Those with and without a clinical diagnosis of MCI differed significantly in age,\np\n= .002; pure-tone hearing in the left ear,\np\n= .007; sex,\np\n= .015; and race,\np\n< .001. These covariates were included in multivariate analysis of covariance, which indicated significant differences between persons with and without MCI on measures of binaural processing (\np\ns\n≤\n.006), but not on measures of temporal processing or degraded speech (\np\ns ≥ .093). Pure-tone hearing averages did not significantly differ among those with or without MCI after adjusting for age, sex, and race (\np\ns ≥ .292).\nCONCLUSIONS: AP in the binaural domain is impaired in MCI, but peripheral hearing did not significantly differ between those with and without MCI. Poor performance on AP measures of binaural processing may reflect problems dividing attention and may be indicative of dementia risk. Results have clinical implications for early detection of and intervention for cognitive impairment.\nPMID:\n38787303\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00166",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to assess how age influences masseter vestibular evoked myogenic potential (mVEMP) parameters by utilizing 500-Hz tone burst stimuli delivered through air conduction.\nMETHOD: The study involved 110 participants ranging from 15 to 60 years of age, grouped into five categories, all of whom had no previous issues related to their vestibular system. The participants were exposed to 500-Hz tone burst stimuli at 125 dB SPL through ER-3A inserts. These stimuli were presented to one ear at a time, with alternating polarity. A Tukey's honestly significant difference test was conducted to compare rectified and unrectified amplitude, along with latencies (P11 and N21) and the asymmetric ratio across all age groups. Additionally, a multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the impact of sex on the study variables.\nRESULTS: All 110 participants (220 ears) in the study provided mVEMP responses, encompassing 100% of the subjects. The results revealed a significant reduction in both amplitude and latency extension for the P11 and N21 peaks. Interestingly, P11 latency was also prolonged in the youngest participants (Group 1), suggesting ongoing maturation of the system even beyond the age of 16 years. Moreover, a significant sex difference was observed in the P11 latencies. However, there were no substantial sex differences (\np\n> .05) in N1 peak latency, peak-to-peak amplitude, rectified amplitude, and asymmetric ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: Changes in structure occur due to degeneration, and the quantity of vestibular sensory hair cells gradually diminishes with age. The rate of decline is faster in semicircular canals compared to end organs, as observed by Merchant et al. (2000). Following a linear degeneration starting at the age of 40 years, a continuous reduction in sensory cells and primary neurons takes place until approximately 40% of vestibular sensory cells are lost by the age of 75 years and insufficient maturation can lead to prolonged peaks and reduced amplitudes compared with those that are considered normal. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the age of the participants when making diagnoses and incorporate relevant correction factors based on age-related reference data.\nPMID:\n38843439\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00264",

Here, we evaluated one such system from TympaHealth by comparing air conduction thresholds and resultant hearing aid targets and output, measured with the TympaHealth system with those measured using standard audiometry.\nDESIGN: The hearing thresholds of 35 adults were measured using standard audiometry and the TympaHealth system. Each set of thresholds was used to generate NAL-NL2 targets and program a hearing aid. The data from each system were compared.\nRESULTS: Bland-Altman analyses showed overall mean differences between thresholds measured with each system to be small, with 85% of TympaHealth thresholds being within ±5 dB of the standard audiometric thresholds, although TympaHealth thresholds were higher (poorer) than the standard audiometric thresholds. The hearing aid targets and gains generated from the standard audiometric thresholds were lower (less amplification) than those generated from the TympaHealth thresholds but again, mean differences at each frequency were small and likely imperceptible.\nCONCLUSION: These findings support the possibility that valid hearing testing can take place outside of a clinical booth using portable systems like that from TympaHealth, opening up the possibility of testing hearing and fitting hearing aids through pharmacies, opticians, and in care homes.\nPMID:\n38848255\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00002",

The goal of this systematic review was to ascertain the percentage of studies conducted in the United States in the past 2 decades that reported relevant demographic variables.\nMETHOD: Studies were searched across eight databases and clinical trial registries in October 2022. Variations of the following search strings were used to retrieve peer-reviewed published studies and unpublished clinical trials: children, hearing loss, and intervention.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies were reviewed and coded for the following demographic variables: area and type of intervention, participant age, hearing technology data, sample size, gender, race/skin color and ethnicity, primary/home language(s), additional disabilities, parental education, family income, and parental occupation. Results revealed that many demographic variables were remarkably underreported, with parental education, family income, and parental occupation variables being the least reported data.\nCONCLUSIONS: Demographic data can be an important tool for changing disparities related to intervention outcomes. This systematic review suggests that inclusive research practices should be extended to low-literacy or low-economic resources, non-White, and non-English-speaking groups. Inclusion practices coupled with sufficient sample sizes will ultimately aid in identifying hearing health disparities.\nPMID:\n38861427\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00208",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Most modern hearing aids (HAs) employ wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and noise reduction (NR) algorithms. It is known that the nonlinear effects of WDRC and NR cause changes to the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an HA. However, the relative contributions of WDRC and NR to the nonlinear effects are not fully understood. The current study investigated (a) whether WDRC or NR dominates the nonlinear effects measured at the output of a digital HA and (b) whether the electroacoustic effectiveness of NR depends on WDRC parameters while input SNR and background noise are systematically varied.\nMETHOD: Test stimuli were Connected Speech Test sentences in multitalker babble noise (2- or 20-talker), presented at input SNRs ranging from -10 to +10 dB. The HA was programmed using multiband WDRC set according to the National Acoustic Laboratories for Nonlinear HA fitting formula 2 prescriptive fits for four standard audiograms and two compression speeds. The NR algorithm of the HA was switched on or off in separate conditions. Nonlinear electroacoustic effects from the WDRC and NR algorithms were assessed by measuring the output SNR of the HA using a phase-inversion technique. To investigate whether there are other factors that may be important besides the output SNR, the Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index were applied to the recordings to generate inferences on aided speech intelligibility and perceived speech quality.\nRESULTS: Results showed that WDRC dominated the net nonlinear effect at low-input SNRs, and the net nonlinear effect of WDRC and NR was reduced at high-input SNRs. Results also showed that the effectiveness of NR depended on compression parameters. The effectiveness of NR was partially explained by the trend of Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index scores, potentially indicating that the Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index scores may capture factors that cannot be captured by the output SNR metric.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the individual signal-processing stages in an HA should not be considered as independent. Electroacoustic evaluation of WDRC and NR algorithms in isolation is not sufficient to capture the combined nonlinear effect of the two algorithms.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25962541.\nPMID:\n38875482\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00011",

These participants were assessed using two standard protocols in a randomized order.\nRESULTS: Results from 77 participants (\nM\nage\n= 46 years; 43 women, 34 men) were analyzed. Pearson's correlation coefficient and simple linear regression indicated a statistically significant relationship between crHIT gain output and age (\np\n> .05) for right gain, 1030°/s\n2\n, and left gain, 1005°/s\n2\n. Although a statistically significant relationship was found, the slope was minor, demonstrating that the clinical effect of age on crHIT gain output was insignificant. Furthermore, no statistically significant relationship exists between crHIT gain output and gender (\np\n> .05). Age-dependent normative data were calculated using the 2.5th and 97.5th confidence interval (CI) percentile method. The responses of angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) gain values for crHIT are expected to occur within the range for lower limit reference interval (RI) of 0.85-0.9 and upper limit RI of 1.11-1.18 for 1030°/s\n2\nand lower limit RI of 0.86-0.92 and upper limit RI of 1.13-1.16 for 1005°/s\n2\n. It can be expected that 90% CI of the population with normal lateral SCC functioning will have aVOR gain values that fall within this range.\nCONCLUSION: Despite a statistically significant relationship that exists with aVOR gain output and age, the changes are minor, declining by 0.0088 units per 10 years, justifying the same normative data for all decade age bands.\nPMID:\n38889375\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-22-00190",

Thirty young adults age 18-30 years (16 men, 14 women by self-identification) completed sinusoidal harmonic acceleration testing in a rotary chair under five different conditions, each at three rotational frequencies (0.01, 0.08, and 0.32 Hz). We recorded gain as the ratio of the amplitude of eye movement to chair movement using standard clinical procedures. The five conditions consisted of two without spatial information (silence, tasking via headphones) and three with either auditory (refrigerator sound, tasking via speaker) or somatosensory (fan) information. Two of the conditions also included mental tasking (tasking via headphones, tasking via speaker) and differed only in terms of the spatial localizability of the verbal instructions. We used linear mixed-effects modeling to compare pairs of conditions, specifically examining the effects of the availability of spatial cues in the environment. This study was preregistered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2gqcf/).\nRESULTS: Results showed significant effects of frequency in all conditions (\np\n< .05), but the only pairs of conditions that were significantly different were those including tasking in one condition but not the other (e.g., tasking via headphones vs. silence). Post hoc equivalence testing showed that the lack of significance in the other comparisons could be confirmed as not meaningfully different.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the presence of externally localizable sensory information, whether auditory or somatosensory, does not affect measures of gain in RCT to any relevant degree. However, these findings also contribute to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that mental engagement (\"tasking\") does increase gain whether or not it is provided via localizable instructions.\nPMID:\n38896881\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00017",

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up until June 30, 2023.\nRESULTS: Primary outcomes focused on complete resolution of vertiginous symptoms measured by either a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test. Secondary outcomes included conversion of a positive DH test to a negative DH test exclusively looking at positional nystagmus and assessment of side effects (cervical/back pain, posttreatment dizziness, and nausea). Both outcomes were assessed within a maximum of 4-week follow-up. Following systematic search and review, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs;\np\n= .413) were found. The studies reported on the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared to three other specific RM: Semont, Li, and Gans maneuvers. Results revealed a low to very low certainty of evidence. With the primary outcomes, Epley maneuver was superior to Gans maneuver 24-hr posttreatment but not after 1 week. No significant differences were found between the remaining maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, evidence of low to very low certainty indicates that Epley maneuver is comparable with Semont, Gans, and Li maneuvers for vertiginous symptoms in patients with P-BPPV. Further high-quality studies are needed.\nPMID:\n38900988\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00177",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Cauliflower ear in wrestlers can lead to hearing impairment. This study primarily aims to assess the hearing of wrestlers with bilateral cauliflower ears and determine their external ear canal (EEC) resonance frequencies. Our second aim is to evaluate their hearing quality, speech, and spatial perception.\nMETHOD: This study included 28 male wrestlers aged 18-35 years with bilateral cauliflower ears, as well as 27 male participants in the control group with no wrestling history. The participants' hearing thresholds were determined across the frequency range of 125-16000 Hz for air-conduction and 500-4000 Hz for bone conduction. EEC resonance frequencies were measured. Additionally, all participants completed the Turkish version of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) questionnaire.\nRESULTS: Wrestlers with cauliflower ears exhibited significantly higher hearing thresholds, particularly at frequencies above 4000 Hz (\np\n< .05). Analysis of EEC resonance showed a shift to higher frequencies in the second resonance peak of the right ear (\np\n< .001) and the first resonance peak of the left ear (\np\n= .045). SSQ scores revealed that wrestlers had higher spatial perception (\np\n= .046), hearing quality (\np\n= .004), and general scores (\np\n= .042) in comparison to the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blunt traumas in wrestlers, leading to cauliflower ear, can result in hearing loss. Moreover, deformities in the external ear affect the resonance frequencies of the EEC. Therefore, it is crucial to advocate for the use of ear protection equipment among wrestlers. When fitting hearing aids, attention should be given to changes in the EEC resonance frequency.\nPMID:\n38917152\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00277",

This study aimed to evaluate changes in attenuation over time for properly fit devices when worn by workers exposed to hazardous noise. Earplug fit testing was accomplished on 30 workers at a brewery facility with three types of foam and three types of premolded earplugs. The personal attenuation ratings (PARs) were measured before and after a 2-hour work period while exposed to hazardous noise levels. The minimum acceptable initial PAR was 15 dB. Average decreases in PAR ranged from -0.7 to -2.6 dB across all six earplug types. Significant changes in PAR were observed for the Foam-1 (\np\n= 0.009) and Premold-3 (\np\n= 0.004) earplugs. A linear mixed regression model using HPD type and study year as fixed effects and subject as random effect was not significant for either fixed effect (\nα\n= 0.05). Ninety-five percent of the final PAR measurements maintained the target attenuation of 15 dB. Properly fitting earplugs can be effective at reducing worker's noise exposures over time. The potential for a decrease in attenuation during the work shift should be considered when training workers and establishing the adequacy of protection from hazardous noise exposures.\nPMID:\n37818150\n| PMC:\nPMC10562054\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1769586",

However, the impaired sensory and/or cognitive mechanisms underlying these auditory difficulties are largely unknown. This work used a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological measures to explore how neural stimulus discrimination and processing speed contribute to impaired temporal processing in blast-exposed Veterans measured using the behavioral Gaps-in-Noise (GIN) Test. Results confirm previous findings that blast exposure can impact performance on the GIN and effect neural auditory discrimination, as measured using the P3 auditory event-related potential. Furthermore, analyses revealed correlations between GIN thresholds, P3 responses, and a measure of behavioral reaction time. Overall, this work illustrates that behavioral responses to the GIN are dependent on both auditory-specific bottom-up processing beginning with the neural activation of the cochlea and auditory brainstem as well as contributions from complex neural networks involved in processing speed and task-dependent target detection.\nPMID:\n38370515\n| PMC:\nPMC10872670\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770139",

Severe tinnitus can be associated with negative impacts on daily life. Veterans with severe tinnitus may also have greater difficulties in functional roles, including work. However, few studies have explicitly explored this relationship. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also prevalent among Veterans, is associated with tinnitus and can additionally impair work functioning. This quantitative investigation used a population-based survey to assess the relationship between tinnitus severity, measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the impact of tinnitus on work, measured using a composite score from the Tinnitus History Questionnaire, among a stratified random sample of VA healthcare-using Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, with and without comorbid TBI. Analyses were weighted to account for sampling design and Veteran non-response; multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Results indicated that for every 1-point increase in TFI score, there was an average 8% increase in the odds of reporting a high level of impact on work functioning (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.11). Veterans with a comorbid TBI diagnosis, compared with those without, were more likely to have high tinnitus-related impact on work functioning (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.85, 3.91), but the relationship between tinnitus severity and the impact of tinnitus on work functioning did not differ by TBI status. These data can help researchers and clinicians understand complex symptoms experienced by Veterans with tinnitus, with and without TBI, supporting the improved provision of clinical services to these patients.\nPMID:\n38370516\n| PMC:\nPMC10872655\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770152",

It is analogous to ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. OCT has recently been introduced in auditory research to visualize the various structures of the ear with a minimally invasive operation. In addition, OCT can be used as a vibrometry system that is capable to detect sound-induced sub-nanometer vibrations of the middle and inner ear. OCT-vibrometry measures depth-resolved vibrations into the specimen, which overcomes several limitations of classical vibrometry techniques (e.g., single surface point measurements using laser interferometry). In this article, we illustrate how to visualize the anatomy and function of the middle and inner ear (the cochlea) in a gerbil model using recently developed spectral-domain OCT. Our results demonstrate that the largest clinical impact of OCT for otology is to visualize various pathologies and quantify sound conduction and processing in the individual peripheral human ear.\nPMID:\n38370517\n| PMC:\nPMC10872649\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770154",

Many speech-in-noise tests have been developed and used to varying degrees. However, multiple barriers have prevented speech-in-noise testing from being used widely in the clinic. The purpose of this article is to provide a resource to audiologists and other hearing health professionals who want to know (1) what tests are available for use, (2) the rationale behind specific tests, and (3) important considerations when selecting one or more tests to use clinically. In addition, data are presented for four speech-in-noise tests with the purpose of comparing outcomes as a function of age and hearing status. The four tests (QuickSIN, Words in Noise [WIN], Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences [LiSN-S], and Coordinate Response Measure [CRM]) were completed by 30 individuals from three groups: 10 young adults with normal hearing, 10 older adults with normal hearing, and 10 older adults with hearing loss. The results suggest that, despite significant differences in performance between groups, group overlap was present such that some individuals from one group performed similar to some individuals of other groups; therefore, individual performance was more important than associated group. When selecting an appropriate speech-in-noise test to use clinically, audiologists should carefully consider the purpose of their testing and the type of information they desire as an outcome. A quick-resource table and appendix is provided to aid audiologists and other health professionals in their selection of an appropriate speech-in-noise test.\nPMID:\n38370518\n| PMC:\nPMC10872656\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770155",

We sought to understand tinnitus rehabilitation service needs and preferences among Veterans with bothersome tinnitus who use Veterans Affairs (VA) services. We conducted semistructured telephone interviews in 2019 with Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, who reported it as bothersome. Veterans were purposively sampled to represent national VA users, with and without comorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI), and who were or were not interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services. Qualitative data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Among 40 Veterans interviewed (32 men, 8 women; 50% with TBI), 72.5% endorsed being somewhat/very likely to be interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services while 27.5% were very/somewhat unlikely. Themes related to Veterans' interest in tinnitus rehabilitation services included barriers and facilitators to participation and preferences for receiving tinnitus services (e.g., individual vs. group-based; in-person vs. remote access). Our findings highlight factors that influence Veterans' reported need and preferences for, and readiness to engage in, rehabilitation services for tinnitus.

However, physical and biological constraints ensure that these signals are perceived slightly asynchronously. The brain only recognizes them as simultaneous when they occur within a period of time called the temporal binding window (TBW). Aging can prolong the TBW, leading to temporal uncertainty during multisensory integration. This effect might contribute to imbalance in the elderly but has not been examined with respect to vestibular inputs. Here, we compared the vestibular-related TBW in 13 younger and 12 older subjects undergoing 0.5 Hz sinusoidal rotations about the earth-vertical axis. An alternating dichotic auditory stimulus was presented at the same frequency but with the phase varied to determine the temporal range over which the two stimuli were perceived as simultaneous at least 75% of the time, defined as the TBW. The mean TBW among younger subjects was 286 ms (SEM ± 56 ms) and among older subjects was 560 ms (SEM ± 52 ms). TBW was related to vestibular sensitivity among younger but not older subjects, suggesting that a prolonged TBW could be a mechanism for imbalance in the elderly person independent of changes in peripheral vestibular function.\nPMID:\n38370520\n| PMC:\nPMC10872654\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770137",

The parameters of sound that may cause beneficial effects, however, are currently only theorized with limited data supporting their effectiveness. Residual inhibition is the temporary suppression or elimination of tinnitus that is usually observed following appropriate auditory stimulation. Our pilot study investigated the effects of a therapeutic acoustic stimulus that was individually customized to maximize residual inhibition of tinnitus and extend its duration to determine if there could be a sustained suppression of the tinnitus signal (i.e., reduced tinnitus loudness) and a reduction in the psychological and emotional reactions to tinnitus. This pilot study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate the feasibility of residual inhibition technique therapy through daily use of hearing aids and (2) to determine its effects by measuring reactionary changes in tinnitus with the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and perceptual changes in tinnitus loudness. A total of 20 adults (14 males, 6 females; mean age: 58 years, SD = 12.88) with chronic tinnitus were enrolled in a four-visit study that consisted of the following: (1) baseline visit and initiation of the intervention period, (2) a 1-month postintervention visit, (3) 2-month postintervention visit and initiation of a wash-out period, and (4) a 3-month visit to assess the wash-out period and any lasting effects of the intervention. The intervention consisted of fitting bilateral hearing aids and creating an individualized residual inhibition stimulus that was streamed via Bluetooth from a smartphone application to the hearing aids. The participants were instructed to wear the hearing aids and stream the residual inhibition stimulus all waking hours for the 2-month intervention period. During the wash-out period, the participants were instructed to use the hearing aids for amplification, but the residual inhibition stimulus was discontinued. At all visits, the participants completed the TFI, study-specific self-report measures to document perceptions of tinnitus, a psychoacoustic test battery consisting of tinnitus loudness and pitch matching, and a residual inhibition test battery consisting of minimum masking and minimum residual inhibition levels. At the end of the trial, participants were interviewed about the study experience and acceptability of the residual inhibition treatment technique. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted on the two main outcomes (TFI total score and tinnitus loudness) across all four visits. The results showed a significant main effect of visit on the TFI total score (\np\n< 0.0001). Specifically, the results indicated a significant reduction in TFI total scores from baseline to the 1-month post-intervention period, which remained stable across the 2-month post-intervention period and the wash-out period. The ANOVA results did not show a significant change in tinnitus loudness as a function of visit (\np\n= 0.480). The majority of the participants reported a positive experience with the study intervention at their exit interview. This pilot study demonstrated that residual inhibition as a sound therapy for tinnitus, specifically through the daily use of hearing aids, was feasible and acceptable to individuals suffering from chronic tinnitus. In addition, participants showed improvement in reactions to tinnitus as demonstrated by sustained reduction in TFI scores on average over the course of the treatment period. Achieving residual inhibition may also provide patients a feeling of control over their tinnitus, and this may have a synergistic effect in reducing the psychological and emotional distress associated with tinnitus. There was no significant reduction in long-term tinnitus loudness resulting from the residual inhibition treatment; however, the current pilot study may not have had sufficient power to detect such a change. The combination of tinnitus suppression and improved psychosocial/emotional reactions to tinnitus may result in a better quality of life in both the short and long term. A larger-scale study is needed to determine the validity of using residual inhibition as a clinical therapy option and to ascertain any effects on both perception and reactions to tinnitus.\nPMID:\n38370522\n| PMC:\nPMC10872653\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770153",

However, clear evidence is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine if sudden sensorineural hearing loss is associated with COVID-19 illness or its vaccine.\nMETHODS: Retrospective chart review of fifty randomly selected patients from three, 6-month time periods: \"pre-pandemic\", \"early pandemic\", and \"late pandemic\". Group comparisons were performed for demographics, comorbid conditions, audiologic history, audiometric data, speech reception thresholds, and word recognition.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were included in this study. A mean difference was observed in that the relative percentage of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) cases increased over time, corresponding to a relative decrease in conductive hearing loss cases. However, this change was not explained by proportional changes in sudden SNHL. Patients in the early pandemic time period were more likely to report tinnitus. Otherwise, the patient groups did not differ on demographic variables, hearing health history, hearing loss presentation, pure tone averages, speech reception thresholds, or word recognition performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proportion of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss did not change over time from the pre-pandemic period to the early or late pandemic phases. Despite a randomized sample, these findings do not support the hypothesis that COVID-19 illness or vaccine is associated with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38880092\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539791",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: The primary goal is to investigate the suitability of CHAPS for assessing cognitive abilities and auditory processing in people with hearing loss, specifically in the domains of auditory processing, verbal working memory, and auditory attention.\nMETHOD: The study comprised 44 individuals between the ages of seven and 14, 22 with hearing loss (N = 11 males), and 22 with normal hearing (N = 10 males). Individuals' auditory attention, working memory, and auditory processing skills were assessed in the study, and self-report questionnaires were used. The evaluation utilized the Sustained Auditory Attention Capacity Test (SAACT), Working Memory Scale (WMS), Filtered Words Test, Auditory Figured Ground Test (AFGT), and the Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS). Analyses were conducted, including group comparisons, correlation examinations, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) evaluations.\nRESULTS: There were significant differences in CHAPS total, attention, noise, quiet, and multiple inputs between groups. No significant differences were seen in CHAPS_ideal and CHAPS_auditory memory across groups. The study of SAACT and its subscores, WMS and its subscores, FWT, and AFGT revealed a significant difference between groups, caused by the poor performance of persons in the HL group compared to those in the NH group. The SAACT and its subscores correlated significantly with CHAPS_attention. The AUC calculation showed that The SAACT and CHAPS_attention distinguished persons with or without hearing loss (p&lt;0.05). WMS_stm and WMS_total correlated with CHAPS auditory memory subscale, however WMS_vwm did not. AUC values for WMS and its subscores showed significant discrimination in identifying children with or without hearing loss (p&lt;0.05), whereas CHAPS_auditory memory did not (AUC=0.665; p=0.060). FWT and AFGT had a significant relationship with CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subscales. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests only correlated with AFGT. CHAPS_quite and CHAPS_ideal did not exhibit significant discriminative values (p&lt;0.05) for identifying children with or without hearing loss, while CHAPS_noise, CHAPS_multiple inputs, FWT, and AFGT did.\nCONCLUSION: The CHAPS_attention subscale could be a trustworthy instrument for assessing auditory attention in children with hearing loss. However, the CHAPS_auditory memory subscale may not be suitable for testing working memory.

The preservation of auditory neuronal and sensory neural hearing cells has a positive impact on auditory perception after implantation. This study aimed to provide details on a semi-automated spiral ganglion neuronal cell counting method, developed using whole implanted gerbil cochlea acquisitions with light sheet microscopy.\nMETHODS: Mongolian gerbils underwent right cochlear implantation with an electrode array whose silicone was loaded with dexamethasone or not and were euthanized 10 weeks after implantation. The cochleae were prepared according to a 29-day protocol, with the electrode array in place. Light sheet microscopy was used for acquisition, and Imaris software was employed for three-dimensional analysis of the cochleas and semi-automatic quantification of spiral ganglion cells. The imaJ software was used for manual quantification of these cells.\nRESULTS: Six cochleae were acquired by light-sheet microscopy, allowing good identification of cells. There was no significant difference between the mean number of spiral ganglion cell obtained by manual and semi-automatic counting (p = 0,25).\nCONCLUSION: Light sheet microscopy provided complete visualization of the spiral ganglion and cell identification. The semi-automated counting method developed using Imaris software tools proved reliable and efficient and could be applied to a larger sample to assess post-cochlear implant cell damage and the efficacy of protective drugs delivered to the inner ear.\nPMID:\n38810615\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539569",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND: Many studies have shown increased academic problems in children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL). However, whether hearing devices can ameliorate the educational difficulties associated with UHL is not well studied. Therefore, the objective of the current systematic review was to answer the question: Do non-surgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, and/or cochlear implants improve academic outcomes in school-aged children and adolescents with UHL?\nMETHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to 12/21/22. Published, peer-reviewed studies comparing academic outcomes in patients with UHL aged ≥ 5 and ≤ 19 years with and without hearing devices (non-surgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, or cochlear implants) were included. Results of studies were qualitatively synthesized, and the risk of bias was evaluated with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 5,644 non-duplicate publications were identified by the search, and four studies were included for synthesis, every one of which was investigating non-surgical amplification. One small, single-arm study demonstrated significant improvement in subjective classroom listening difficulties after a 3- to 4-month trial with a BTE hearing aid. The other three studies of non-surgical amplification devices showed no benefit across multiple academic outcomes with FM systems and conventional and CROS-style hearing aids.\nDISCUSSION: The small sample sizes, heterogeneous and/or ill-defined study samples, and overall low quality of the available literature ultimately make it hard to draw definitive conclusions regarding non-surgical amplification devices' effectiveness in improving academic outcomes in children with UHL. No articles were identified that studied cochlear implants or bone-anchored hearing aids. Further studies with high-quality study design, large sample sizes, and long-term follow-up are needed to answer this clinically important question.\nPMID:\n38810609\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539513",

The scores were assessed using the Percent Sentence Recognition Index (PSRI). The data were inferentially analysed using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests with a 95% confidence interval and 5% significance level (p &lt; 0.05).\nRESULTS: The mean age was 41.1 years, the mean duration of CI use was 11.4 years, and the mean hearing threshold was 29.7 ± 5.9 dBHL.

The etiology of otosclerosis remains unknown; factors such as infection, hormones, inflammation, genetics, and autoimmunity have been discussed. Treatment consists primarily of surgical stapes replacement and cochlear implantation. High-resolution computed tomography is routinely used to visualize bone pathology. In the present study, we used synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI) to examine otosclerosis plaques in a temporal bone for the first time. The primary aim was to study their three-dimensional (3D) outline, vascular interrelationships, and connections to the middle ear.\nMETHODS: A donated ear from a patient with otosclerosis who had undergone partial stapedectomy with the insertion of a stapes wire prosthesis was investigated using SR-PCI and compared with a control ear. Otosclerotic lesions were 3D rendered using the composite with shading technique. Scalar opacity and color mapping were adjusted to display volume properties with the removal of bones to enhance surfaces. Vascular bone channels were segmented, and the communications between lesions and the middle ear were established.\nRESULTS: Fenestral, cochlear, meatal, and vestibular lesions were outlined three-dimensionally. Vascular bone channels were found to be frequently connected to the middle ear mucosa, perilabyrinthine air spaces, and facial nerve vessels. Round window lesions partly embedded the cochlear aqueduct which was pathologically narrowed, while the inferior cochlear vein was significantly dilated in its proximal part.\nCONCLUSION: Otosclerotic/otospongiotic lesions were imaged for the first time using SR-PCI and 3D rendering. The presence of shunts and abnormal vascular connections to the labyrinth appeared to result in hyper-vascularization, overloading the venous system, and leading to sensorineural hearing loss. We speculate about possible local treatments to alleviate the impact of such critical lesions on the labyrinthine microcirculation.\nPMID:\n38763131\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539422",

The time course of the involved pathologies is still under investigation. Several studies have demonstrated an acute damage of the sensory tissue, but only few experiments investigated the degeneration of (type I) spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), representing the primary neurons in the auditory system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of SGN degeneration within a 7-day period after traumatic noise exposure starting immediately after trauma.\nMETHODS: Young adult normal hearing mice were noise exposed for 3 h with a broadband noise (5-20 kHz) at 115 dB SPL. Auditory threshold shift was measured by auditory brainstem recordings, and SGN densities were analyzed at different time points during the first week after acoustic trauma.\nRESULTS: Significant reduction of SGN densities was detected and is accompanied by a significant hearing loss. Degeneration starts within hours after the applied trauma, further progressing within days post-exposure.\nDISCUSSION: Early neurodegeneration in the auditory periphery seems to be induced by direct overstimulation of the auditory nerve fibers. SGN loss is supposed to be a result of inflammatory responses and neural deprivation, leading to permanent hearing loss and auditory processing deficits.\nPMID:\n38749408\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539359",

This variability may be related to brain changes associated with intact senses recruiting cortical areas from stimulation-deprived senses. Numerous studies have demonstrated such cross-modal reorganization in individuals with untreated hearing loss. How it is affected by regular use of hearing devices remains unclear, however. To shed light on this, the current study measured cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities in experienced CI users and normal-hearing controls.\nMETHODS: Using multichannel electroencephalography, we tested CI users who had used their devices for at least 12 months and closely matched controls (N = 2 × 13). Cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities - the N400 and late positive complex (LPC) components - were evoked using congruent and incongruent digit-triplet stimuli. The participants' task was to assess digit-triplet congruency by means of timed button presses. All measurements were performed in speech-shaped noise 15 dB above individually measured speech recognition thresholds. Three stimulus presentation modes were used: auditory-only, visual-only, and visual-then-auditory.\nRESULTS: The analyses revealed no group differences in the N400 and LPC responses. In terms of response times, the CI users were slower and differentially affected by the three stimulus presentation modes relative to the controls.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to normal-hearing controls, experienced CI users may need more time to comprehend speech in noise. Response times can serve as a proxy for speech comprehension by CI users.\nPMID:\n38679013\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538701",

A newer Fast method - Italian Fast Speech Reception Threshold 50 (IFastSRT50) - is performed by means of program software with a single list of bisyllabic words and noise intensity shifting.\nRESULTS: Means comparison between SRT50 Classic and IFastSRT50 shows a slight significant correlation (r = 0.263; p = 0.044) and a wide significant difference: SRT50 Classic = -2.763 dB (SD = 4.1) and IFastSRT50 = -7.803 dB (SD = 2.1) (p &lt; 0.0001). There is a high difference between the test execution time means (SRT50 Classic = 11 min, IFastSRT50 = 2 min; p &lt; 0.0001). The correlation between test results and execution times was higher for SRT50 Classic than IFastSRT50.\nCONCLUSION: IFastSRT50 test is a reliable method to quickly investigate signal-to-noise ratio needed to obtain 50% of recognition scores with bisyllabic words; it allows less execution time than SRT50 Classic method and can avoid patient fatigue and other limitations of different speech discrimination tests in noise as sentences based ones.\nPMID:\n38631316\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538556",

The study encompassed the assessment of the clinical presentation, treatment, quality of life, and evolution after treatment of the identified individuals.\nRESULTS: During the study period, six patients, aged between 33 and 71 years, developed vestibular ototoxicity following the use of topical aminoglycoside drops due infection flares in chronic otitis media. All cases involved the use of gentamicin. Two cases were unilateral, and four were unilateral. The onset of symptoms occurred within one to four weeks of using the drops, resulting in all patients experiencing instability without vertigo attacks. After discontinuing the drops and undergoing vestibular rehabilitation, four patients experienced sequelae, with two patients (both with bilateral vestibular hypofunction) suffering significant impairment in their quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Vestibular ototoxicity due to the topical application of aminoglycosides during acute exacerbations of chronic otitis media is a rare occurrence. However, given its potential for severe consequences and the fact that we are still encountering patients with this condition, healthcare professionals should explore alternative antibacterial agents that offer similar efficacy.\nPMID:\n38588647\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538756",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Studies have identified a greater risk of sensory neural hearing loss in individuals with COPD compared to healthy individuals, but it is unclear whether they are at increased risk of hearing loss with impaired speech recognition. The aim of this study was to assess whether COPD is associated with hearing loss that affects speech recognition.\nMETHODS: This is a case-control study. We screened individuals from health facilities in the municipality of Jundiai. We enrolled a test group of individuals with COPD and an age-matched control group composed of individuals with asthma. The selected individuals attended an appointment with a chest physician, responded questionnaires and underwent tonal and speech audiometry. Adjusted binary logistic regression analysis evaluated whether COPD was associated with reduced speech recognition.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 36 individuals with COPD and 72 with asthma. Individuals with COPD were more likely to have a reduced speech recognition compared to asthmatic individuals [Reduced recognition of three-syllable words: adjusted OR 3.72, 95 CI (1.38 - 10.02)] [Reduced recognition of monosyllable words: adjusted OR 4.74, 95 CI (1.52 - 14.76)].\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that individuals with COPD from primary and secondary healthcare facilities have at least 38% greater risk of hearing loss with reduced speech recognition compared to an age-matched control group of individuals with asthma recruited from the same facilities. We recommend that longitudinal studies evaluate whether regular screening could contribute to the prevention or early treatment of hearing loss in individuals with moderate-severe COPD.\nPMID:\n38574469\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538700",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Auditory performance in noise of cochlear implant recipients can be assessed with the adaptive Matrix test (MT); however, when the speech-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds 15 dB, the background noise has any negative impact on the speech recognition. Here, we aim to evaluate the predictive power of aided pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in quiet, and establish cut-off values for both tests that indicate whether auditory performance in noise can be assessed using the Matrix sentence test in a diffuse noise environment.\nMETHODS: Here, we assessed the power of pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in quiet to predict the response to the MT. Ninety-eight cochlear implant recipients were assessed using different sound processors from Advanced Bionics (n=56) and Cochlear (n=42). Auditory tests were performed at least 1-year after cochlear implantation or upgrading the sound processor to ensure the best benefit of the implant. Auditory assessment of the implanted ear in free-field conditions included: pure-tone average (PTA), speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet at 65 dB, and speech recognition threshold (SRT) in noise that is the SNR at which the patient can correctly recognize 50% of the words using the MT in a diffuse sound field.\nRESULTS: The SRT in noise was determined in sixty patients (61%) and undetermined in 38 (39%) using the MT. When cut-off values for PTA <36 dB and SDS >41% were used separately, they were able to predict a positive response to the MT in 83% of recipients; using both cut-off values together, the predictive value reached 92%.\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: As the pure-tone audiometry is standardized universally and the speech recognition in quiet could vary depending on the language used; we propose that the MT should be performed in recipients with PTA <36 dB, and in recipients with PTA >36 dB, a list of Matrix sentences at a fixed SNR should be presented to determine the percentage of words understood. This approach should enable clinicians to obtain information about auditory performance in noise whenever possible.\nPMID:\n38527427\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000535622",
