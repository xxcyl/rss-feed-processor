Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have a higher incidence of hearing loss (HL) compared with their peers without developmental disabilities. Little is known about the associations between HL and functional hearing for individuals with DS. This study investigated two aspects of auditory functions, \"what\" (understanding the content of sound) and \"where\" (localizing the source of sound), in young adults with DS. Speech reception thresholds in quiet and in the presence of interferers provided insight into speech recognition, that is, the \"what\" aspect of auditory maturation. Insights into \"where\" aspect of auditory maturation were gained from evaluating speech reception thresholds in colocated versus separated conditions (quantifying spatial release from masking) as well as right versus left discrimination and sound location identification. Auditory functions in the \"where\" domain develop during earlier stages of cognitive development in contrast with the later developing \"what\" functions. We hypothesized that young adults with DS would exhibit stronger \"where\" than \"what\" auditory functioning, albeit with the potential impact of HL. Considering the importance of auditory working memory and receptive vocabulary for speech recognition, we hypothesized that better speech recognition in young adults with DS, in quiet and with speech interferers, would be associated with better auditory working memory ability and receptive vocabulary.\nDESIGN: Nineteen young adults with DS (aged 19 to 24 years) participated in the study and completed assessments on pure-tone audiometry, right versus left discrimination, sound location identification, and speech recognition in quiet and with speech interferers that were colocated or spatially separated. Results were compared with published data from children and adults without DS and HL, tested using similar protocols and stimuli. Digit Span tests assessed auditory working memory. Receptive vocabulary was examined using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Fifth Edition.\nRESULTS: Seven participants (37%) had HL in at least 1 ear; 4 individuals had mild HL, and 3 had moderate HL or worse. Participants with mild or no HL had ≥75% correct at 5° separation on the discrimination task and sound localization root mean square errors (mean ± SD: 8.73° ± 2.63°) within the range of adults in the comparison group. Speech reception thresholds in young adults with DS were higher than all comparison groups. However, spatial release from masking did not differ between young adults with DS and comparison groups. Better (lower) speech reception thresholds were associated with better hearing and better auditory working memory ability. Receptive vocabulary did not predict speech recognition.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the absence of HL, young adults with DS exhibited higher accuracy during spatial hearing tasks as compared with speech recognition tasks. Thus, auditory processes associated with the \"where\" pathways appear to be a relative strength than those associated with \"what\" pathways in young adults with DS. Further, both HL and auditory working memory impairments contributed to difficulties in speech recognition in the presence of speech interferers. Future larger-sized samples are needed to replicate and extend our findings.\nPMID:\n39090791\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001549",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: This study investigated the efficiency of a multiplexed amplitude-modulated (AM) stimulus in eliciting auditory steady-state responses. The multiplexed AM stimulus was created by simultaneously modulating speech-shaped noise with three frequencies chosen to elicit different neural generators: 3.1, 40.1, and 102.1 Hz. For comparison, a single AM stimulus was created for each of these frequencies, resulting in three single AM conditions and one multiplex AM condition.\nDESIGN: Twenty-two bilaterally normal-hearing participants (18 females) listened for 8 minutes to each type of stimuli. The analysis compared the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and amplitudes of the evoked responses to the single and multiplexed conditions.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that the SNRs elicited by single AM conditions were, on average, 1.61 dB higher than those evoked by the multiplexed AM condition ( p < 0.05). The single conditions consistently produced a significantly higher SNR when examining various stimulus durations ranging from 1 to 8 minutes. Despite these SNR differences, the frequency spectrum was very similar across and within subjects. In addition, the sensor space patterns across the scalp demonstrated similar trends between the single and multiplexed stimuli for both SNR and amplitudes. Both the single and multiplexed conditions evoked significant auditory steady-state responses within subjects. On average, the multiplexed AM stimulus took 31 minutes for the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval to cross the significance threshold across all three frequencies. In contrast, the single AM stimuli took 45 minutes and 42 seconds.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the multiplexed AM stimulus is a promising method to reduce the recording time when simultaneously obtaining information from various neural generators.\nPMID:\n39085997\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001552",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: The inter-phase gap (IPG) offset effect is defined as the dB offset between the linear parts of electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) amplitude growth functions for two stimuli differing only in IPG. The method was recently suggested to represent neural health in cochlear implant (CI) users while being unaffected by CI electrode impedances. Hereby, a larger IPG offset effect should reflect better neural health. The aims of the present study were to (1) examine whether the IPG offset effect negatively correlates with the ECAP threshold and the preoperative pure-tone average (PTA) in CI recipients with residual acoustic hearing and (2) investigate the dependency of the IPG offset effect on hair cell survival and intracochlear electrode impedances.\nDESIGN: Seventeen adult study participants with residual acoustic hearing at 500 Hz undergoing CI surgery at the University Hospital of Zurich were prospectively enrolled. ECAP thresholds, IPG offset effects, electrocochleography (ECochG) responses to 500 Hz tone bursts, and monopolar electrical impedances were obtained at an apical, middle, and basal electrode set during and between 4 and 12 weeks after CI surgery. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted within 3 weeks before surgery and approximately 6 weeks after surgery. Linear mixed regression analyses and t tests were performed to assess relationships between (changes in) ECAP threshold, IPG offset, impedance, PTA, and ECochG amplitude.\nRESULTS: The IPG offset effect positively correlated with the ECAP threshold in intraoperative recordings (p < 0.001) and did not significantly correlate with the preoperative PTA (p = 0.999). The IPG offset showed a postoperative decrease for electrode sets that showed an ECochG amplitude drop. This IPG offset decrease was significantly larger than for electrode sets that showed no ECochG amplitude decrease, t(17) = 2.76, p = 0.014. Linear mixed regression analysis showed no systematic effect of electrode impedance changes on the IPG offset effect (p = 0.263) but suggested a participant-dependent effect of electrode impedance on IPG offset.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study results did not reveal the expected relationships between the IPG offset effect and ECAP threshold values or between the IPG offset effect and preoperative acoustic hearing. Changes in electrode impedance did not exhibit a direct impact on the IPG offset effect, although this impact might be individualized among CI recipients. Overall, our findings suggest that the interpretation and application of the IPG offset effect in clinical settings should be approached with caution considering its complex relationships with other cochlear and neural health metrics.\nPMID:\n39054580\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001556",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: To explore postural disability in Usher Syndrome (USH) patients using temporal posturographic analysis to better elucidate sensory compensation strategies of deafblind patients for posture control and correlate the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale with posturographic variables.\nDESIGN: Thirty-four genetically confirmed USH patients (11 USH1, 21 USH2, 2 USH 4) from the Otolaryngology Outpatient Clinic and 35 controls were prospectively studied using both classical and wavelet temporal analysis of center of pressure (CoP) under different visual conditions on static and dynamic platforms. The functional impact of balance was assessed with the ABC scale. Classical data in the spatial domain, Sensorial Organization Test, and frequency analysis of the CoP were analyzed.\nRESULTS: On unstable surfaces, USH1 had greater CoP surface area with eyes open (38.51 ± 68.67) and closed (28.14 ± 31.64) versus controls (3.31 ± 4.60), p < 0.001 and (7.37 ± 7.91), p < 0.001, respectively. On an unstable platform, USH consistently showed increased postural sway, with elevated angular velocity versus controls with eyes open (USH1 [44.94 ± 62.54]; USH2 [55.64 ± 38.61]; controls [13.4 ± 8.57]) (p = 0.003; p < 0.001) and closed (USH1 [60.36 ± 49.85], USH2 [57.62 ± 42.36]; controls [27.31 ± 19.79]) (p = 0.002; p = 0.042). USH visual impairment appears to be the primary factor influencing postural deficits, with a statistically significant difference observed in the visual Sensorial Organization Test ratio for USH1 (80.73 ± 40.07, p = 0.04) and a highly significant difference for USH2 (75.48 ± 31.67, p < 0.001) versus controls (100). In contrast, vestibular (p = 0.08) and somatosensory (p = 0.537) factors did not reach statistical significance. USH exhibited lower visual dependence than controls (30.31 ± 30.08) (USH1 [6 ± 11.46], p = 0.004; USH2 [8 ± 14.15], p = 0.005). The postural instability index, that corresponds to the ratio of spectral power index and canceling time, differentiated USH from controls on unstable surface with eyes open USH1 (3.33 ± 1.85) p < 0.001; USH2 (3.87 ± 1.05) p < 0.002; controls (1.91 ± 0.85) and closed USH1 (3.91 ± 1.65) p = 0.005; USH2 (3.92 ± 1.05) p = 0.045; controls (2.74 ± 1.27), but not USH1 from USH2. The canceling time in the anteroposterior direction in lower zone distinguished USH subtypes on stable surface with optokinetic USH1 (0.88 ± 1.03), USH2 (0.29 ± 0.23), p = 0.026 and on unstable surface with eyes open USH1 (0.56 ± 1.26), USH2 (0.072 ± 0.09), p = 0.036. ABC scale could distinguish between USH patients and controls, but not between USH subtypes and it correlated with CoP surface area on unstable surface with eyes open only in USH1(ρ = 0.714, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSIONS: USH patients, particularly USH1, exhibited poorer balance control than controls on unstable platform with eyes open and appeared to rely more on proprioceptive information while suppressing visual input. USH2 seems to use different multisensory balance strategies that do not align as well with the ABC scale. The advanced analysis provided insights into sensory compensation strategies in USH subtypes.\nPMID:\n39049080\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001558",

It is important to note that it can be enhanced by nonauditory stimuli, for example, through lip-reading in an ongoing conversation. However, how tactile stimuli affect auditory processing is still relatively unclear. Recent studies have shown that brief tactile stimuli can reliably facilitate auditory perception, while studies using longer-lasting audio-tactile stimulation yielded conflicting results. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ongoing pulsating tactile stimulation on basic auditory processing.\nDESIGN: In experiment 1, the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded while 24 participants performed a loudness-discrimination task on a 4-Hz modulated tone-in-noise and received either in-phase, anti-phase, or no 4-Hz electrotactile stimulation above the median nerve. In experiment 2, another 24 participants were presented with the same tactile stimulation as before, but performed a tone-in-noise detection task while their selective auditory attention was manipulated.\nRESULTS: We found that in-phase tactile stimulation enhanced EEG responses to the tone, whereas anti-phase tactile stimulation suppressed these responses. No corresponding tactile effects on loudness-discrimination performance were observed in experiment 1. Using a yes/no paradigm in experiment 2, we found that in-phase tactile stimulation, but not anti-phase tactile stimulation, improved detection thresholds. Selective attention also improved thresholds but did not modulate the observed benefit from in-phase tactile stimulation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that ongoing in-phase tactile input can enhance basic auditory processing as reflected in scalp EEG and detection thresholds. This might have implications for the development of hearing enhancement technologies and interventions.\nPMID:\n39046790\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001566",

Although bilateral cochlear implantation (CI) has been shown to enhance hearing performance and quality of life, its cost-effectiveness remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bilateral CI compared with bimodal hearing for children with sensorineural hearing loss in Taiwan from both the perspectives of patients and Taiwan's National Health Insurance Administration (TNHIA).\nDESIGN: A four-state Markov model was utilized in the study, including \"use the first internal device,\" \"use the second internal device,\" \"use the third internal device,\" and \"death.\" Health utility values were obtained from a local survey of health professionals and then adjusted by a scale to reflect both the negative impact of aging on hearing and the time needed to develop the full benefit of treatment in the earliest years of life. The cost data were derived from a caregiver survey, hospital databases, clinical experts, and the TNHIA. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over the lifetime horizon and presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous bilateral CI, sequential bilateral CI, and bimodal hearing. In addition, one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of uncertainty and the robustness of the model.\nRESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that children with bilateral CI gained more QALYs while incurring more costs when compared with those with bimodal hearing. From the TNHIA perspective, compared with bimodal hearing, the ICER of simultaneous bilateral CI was New Taiwan Dollars 232,662 per QALY whereas from the patient perspective, the ICER was New Taiwan Dollars 1,006,965 per QALY. Moreover, simultaneous bilateral CI dominated sequential bilateral CI from both perspectives. Compared with bimodal hearing, the ICER of sequential bilateral CI did not exceed twice the gross domestic product per capita in Taiwan from either perspective. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the utility gain of bilateral CI compared with bimodal hearing was the most impactful parameter from both perspectives. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the base-case analysis results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that bilateral CI was cost-effective when using the threshold of one to three times the 2022 gross domestic product per capita in Taiwan from both the TNHIA and patient perspectives. Future research incorporating cost and effectiveness data from other dimensions is needed to help decision-makers assess the cost-effectiveness of bilateral CI more comprehensively.\nPMID:\n39044334\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001568",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of two types of auditory training on both behavioral and physiological measures of auditory function in cochlear implant (CI) users, and to examine whether a relationship exists between the behavioral and objective outcome measures.\nDESIGN: This study involved two experiments, both of which used a within-subject design. Outcome measures included behavioral and cortical electrophysiological measures of auditory processing. In Experiment I, 8 CI users participated in a music-based auditory training. The training program included both short training sessions completed in the laboratory as well as a set of 12 training sessions that participants completed at home over the course of a month. As part of the training program, study participants listened to a range of different musical stimuli and were asked to discriminate stimuli that differed in pitch or timbre and to identify melodic changes. Performance was assessed before training and at three intervals during and after training was completed. In Experiment II, 20 CI users participated in a more focused auditory training task: the detection of spectral ripple modulation depth. Training consisted of a single 40-minute session that took place in the laboratory under the supervision of the investigators. Behavioral and physiologic measures of spectral ripple modulation depth detection were obtained immediately pre- and post-training. Data from both experiments were analyzed using mixed linear regressions, paired t tests, correlations, and descriptive statistics.\nRESULTS: In Experiment I, there was a significant improvement in behavioral measures of pitch discrimination after the study participants completed the laboratory and home-based training sessions. There was no significant effect of training on electrophysiologic measures of the auditory N1-P2 onset response and acoustic change complex (ACC). There were no significant relationships between electrophysiologic measures and behavioral outcomes after the month-long training. In Experiment II, there was no significant effect of training on the ACC, although there was a small but significant improvement in behavioral spectral ripple modulation depth thresholds after the short-term training.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that auditory training improves spectral cue perception in CI users, with significant perceptual gains observed despite cortical electrophysiological responses like the ACC not reliably predicting training benefits across short- and long-term interventions. Future research should further explore individual factors that may lead to greater benefit from auditory training, in addition to optimization of training protocols and outcome measures, as well as demonstrate the generalizability of these findings.\nPMID:\n39044323\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001569",

However, a substantial and unexplained variability persists in CI outcomes, even when considering subject-specific factors such as age and the duration of deafness. In a pioneering study, we use resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy to predict speech-understanding outcomes before and after CI implantation. Our hypothesis centers on resting-state functional connectivity (FC) reflecting brain plasticity post-hearing loss and implantation, specifically targeting the average clustering coefficient in resting FC networks to capture variation among CI users.\nDESIGN: Twenty-three CI candidates participated in this study. Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy data were collected preimplantation and at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postimplantation. Speech understanding performance was assessed using consonant-nucleus-consonant words in quiet and Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentences in noise 1-year postimplantation. Resting-state FC networks were constructed using regularized partial correlation, and the average clustering coefficient was measured in the signed weighted networks as a predictive measure for implantation outcomes.\nRESULTS: Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between the average clustering coefficient in resting-state functional networks and speech understanding outcomes, both pre- and postimplantation.\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach uses an easily deployable resting-state functional brain imaging metric to predict speech-understanding outcomes in implant recipients.

This study aimed to objectively determine intraoperative cochlear microphonic (CM) amplitude patterns and correlate them with residual hearing in cochlear implant recipients, addressing the limitations in current ECochG analysis that often depends on subjective visual assessment and overlook the intracochlear measurement location.\nDESIGN: In this prospective study, we investigated intraoperative pure-tone ECochG following complete electrode insertion in 31 patients. We used our previously published objective analysis method to determine the maximum CM amplitude and the associated electrode position for each electrode array. Using computed tomography, we identified electrode placement and determined the corresponding tonotopic frequency using Greenwood's function. Based on this, we calculated the tonotopic shift, that is, the difference between the stimulation frequency and the estimated frequency of the electrode with the maximum CM amplitude. We evaluated the association between CM amplitude, tonotopic shift, and preoperative hearing thresholds using linear regression analysis.\nRESULTS: CM amplitudes showed high variance, with values ranging from -1.479 to 4.495 dBµV. We found a statistically significant negative correlation () between maximum CM amplitudes and preoperative hearing thresholds. In addition, a significant association () between the tonotopic shift and preoperative hearing thresholds was observed. Tonotopic shifts of the maximum CM amplitudes occurred predominantly toward the basal direction.\nCONCLUSIONS: The combination of objective signal analysis and the consideration of intracochlear measurement locations enhances the understanding of cochlear health and overcomes the obstacles of current ECochG analysis. We could show the link between intraoperative CM amplitudes, their spatial distributions, and preoperative hearing thresholds. Consequently, our findings enable automated analysis and bear the potential to enhance specificity of ECochG, reinforcing its role as an objective biomarker for cochlear health.\nPMID:\n39010266\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001546",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Cochlear implants (CI) are remarkably effective, but have limitations regarding the transformation of the spectro-temporal fine structures of speech. This may impair processing of spoken emotions, which involves the identification and integration of semantic and prosodic cues. Our previous study found spoken-emotions-processing differences between CI users with postlingual deafness (postlingual CI) and normal hearing (NH) matched controls (age range, 19 to 65 years). Postlingual CI users over-relied on semantic information in incongruent trials (prosody and semantics present different emotions), but rated congruent trials (same emotion) similarly to controls. Postlingual CI's intact early auditory experience may explain this pattern of results. The present study examined whether CI users without intact early auditory experience (prelingual CI) would generally perform worse on spoken emotion processing than NH and postlingual CI users, and whether CI use would affect prosodic processing in both CI groups. First, we compared prelingual CI users with their NH controls. Second, we compared the results of the present study to our previous study (Taitlebaum-Swead et al. 2022; postlingual CI).\nDESIGN: Fifteen prelingual CI users and 15 NH controls (age range, 18 to 31 years) listened to spoken sentences composed of different combinations (congruent and incongruent) of three discrete emotions (anger, happiness, sadness) and neutrality (performance baseline), presented in prosodic and semantic channels (Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech paradigm). Listeners were asked to rate (six-point scale) the extent to which each of the predefined emotions was conveyed by the sentence as a whole (integration of prosody and semantics), or to focus only on one channel (rating the target emotion [RTE]) and ignore the other (selective attention). In addition, all participants performed standard tests of speech perception. Performance on the Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech was compared with the previous study (postlingual CI).\nRESULTS: When asked to focus on one channel, semantics or prosody, both CI groups showed a decrease in prosodic RTE (compared with controls), but only the prelingual CI group showed a decrease in semantic RTE. When the task called for channel integration, both groups of CI users used semantic emotional information to a greater extent than their NH controls. Both groups of CI users rated sentences that did not present the target emotion higher than their NH controls, indicating some degree of confusion. However, only the prelingual CI group rated congruent sentences lower than their NH controls, suggesting reduced accumulation of information across channels. For prelingual CI users, individual differences in identification of monosyllabic words were significantly related to semantic identification and semantic-prosodic integration.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together with our previous study, we found that the degradation of acoustic information by the CI impairs the processing of prosodic emotions, in both CI user groups. This distortion appears to lead CI users to over-rely on the semantic information when asked to integrate across channels. Early intact auditory exposure among CI users was found to be necessary for the effective identification of semantic emotions, as well as the accumulation of emotional information across the two channels. Results suggest that interventions for spoken-emotion processing should not ignore the onset of hearing loss.\nPMID:\n39004788\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001550",

We aim to provide a comprehensive view of the auditory processing abilities for subjects with acquired AHL, and to examine the influence of AHL on speech perception under difficult conditions, and on auditory temporal and intensity processing.\nDESIGN: We examined peripheral and central auditory functions for 25 subjects with AHL resulting from vestibular schwannoma, and compared them to those from 24 normal-hearing controls that were matched with the AHL subjects in mean age and hearing thresholds in the healthy ear. Besides the basic hearing threshold assessment, the tests comprised the detection of tones and gaps in a continuous noise, comprehension of speech in babble noise, binaural interactions, difference limen of intensity, and detection of frequency modulation. For the AHL subjects, the selected tests were performed separately for the healthy and diseased ear.\nRESULTS: We observed that binaural speech comprehension, gap detection, and frequency modulation detection abilities were dominated by the healthy ear and were comparable for both groups. The AHL subjects were less sensitive to interaural delays, however, they exhibited a higher sensitivity to sound level, as indicated by lower difference limen of intensity and a higher sensitivity to interaural intensity difference. Correlations between the individual test scores indicated that speech comprehension by the AHL subjects was associated with different auditory processing mechanisms than for the control subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that AHL influences both peripheral and central auditory processing abilities and that speech comprehension under difficult conditions relies on different mechanisms for the AHL subjects than for normal-hearing controls.\nPMID:\n39004787\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001555",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Electro-acoustic stimulation (EAS) combines electric stimulation via a cochlear implant (CI) with residual low-frequency acoustic hearing, with benefits for music appreciation and speech perception in noise. However, many EAS CI users lose residual acoustic hearing, reducing this benefit. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether chronic EAS leads to more hearing loss compared with CI surgery alone in an aged guinea pig model, and to assess the relationship of any hearing loss to histology measures. Conversely, it is also important to understand factors impacting efficacy of electric stimulation. If one contributor to CI-induced hearing loss is damage to the auditory nerve, both acoustic and electric thresholds will be affected. Excitotoxicity from EAS may also affect electric thresholds, while electric stimulation is osteogenic and may increase electrode impedances. Hence, secondary objectives were to assess how electric thresholds are related to the amount of residual hearing loss after CI surgery, and how EAS affects electric thresholds and impedances over time.\nDESIGN: Two groups of guinea pigs, aged 9 to 21 months, were implanted with a CI in the left ear. Preoperatively, the animals had a range of hearing losses, as expected for an aged cohort. At 4 weeks after surgery, the EAS group (n = 5) received chronic EAS for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 20 weeks via a tether system that allowed for free movement during stimulation. The nonstimulated group (NS; n = 6) received no EAS over the same timeframe. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and electrically evoked ABRs (EABRs) were recorded at 3 to 4 week intervals to assess changes in acoustic and electric thresholds over time. At 24 weeks after surgery, cochlear tissue was harvested for histological evaluation, only analyzing animals without electrode extrusions (n = 4 per ear).\nRESULTS: Cochlear implantation led to an immediate worsening of ABR thresholds peaking between 3 and 5 weeks after surgery and then recovering and stabilizing by 5 and 8 weeks. Significantly greater ABR threshold shifts were seen in the implanted ears compared with contralateral, non-implanted control ears after surgery. After EAS and termination, no significant additional ABR threshold shifts were seen in the EAS group compared with the NS group. A surprising finding was that NS animals had significantly greater recovery in EABR thresholds over time, with decreases (improvements) of -51.8 ± 33.0 and -39.0 ± 37.3 c.u. at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, compared with EAS animals with EABR threshold increases (worsening) of +1.0 ± 25.6 and 12.8 ± 44.3 c.u. at 12 and 24 weeks. Impedance changes over time did not differ significantly between groups. After exclusion of cases with electrode extrusion or significant trauma, no significant correlations were seen between ABR and EABR thresholds, or between ABR thresholds with histology measures of inner/outer hair cell counts, synaptic ribbon counts, stria vascularis capillary diameters, or spiral ganglion cell density.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings do not indicate that EAS significantly disrupts acoustic hearing, although the small sample size limits this interpretation. No evidence of associations between hair cell, synaptic ribbon, spiral ganglion cell, or stria vascularis with hearing loss after cochlear implantation was seen when surgical trauma is minimized. In cases of major trauma, both acoustic thresholds and electric thresholds were elevated, which may explain why CI-only outcomes are often better when trauma and hearing loss are minimized. Surprisingly, chronic EAS (or electric stimulation alone) may negatively impact electric thresholds, possibly by prevention of recovery of the auditory nerve after CI surgery. More research is needed to confirm the potentially negative impact of chronic EAS on electric threshold recovery.\nPMID:\n38992863\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001545",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Usher syndrome (USH), characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), prompts increased reliance on hearing due to progressive visual deterioration. It can be categorized into three subtypes: USH type 1 (USH1), characterized by severe to profound congenital SNHL, childhood-onset RP, and vestibular areflexia; USH type 2 (USH2), presenting with moderate to severe progressive SNHL and RP onset in the second decade, with or without vestibular dysfunction; and USH type 3 (USH3), featuring variable progressive SNHL beginning in childhood, variable RP onset, and diverse vestibular function. Previous studies evaluating cochlear implant (CI) outcomes in individuals with USH used varying or short follow-up durations, while others did not evaluate outcomes for each subtype separately. This study evaluates long-term CI performance in subjects with USH, at both short-term and long-term, considering each subtype separately.\nDESIGN: This retrospective, observational cohort study identified 36 CI recipients (53 ears) who were categorized into four different groups: early-implanted USH1 (first CI at ≤7 years of age), late-implanted USH1 (first CI at ≥8 years of age), USH2 and USH3. Phoneme scores at 65 dB SPL with CI were evaluated at 1 year, ≥2 years (mid-term), and ≥5 years postimplantation (long-term). Each subtype was analyzed separately due to the significant variability in phenotype observed among the three subtypes.\nRESULTS: Early-implanted USH1-subjects (N = 23 ears) achieved excellent long-term phoneme scores (100% [interquartile ranges {IQR} = 95 to 100]), with younger age at implantation significantly correlating with better CI outcomes. Simultaneously implanted subjects had significantly better outcomes than sequentially implanted subjects (p = 0.028). Late-implanted USH1 subjects (N = 3 ears) used CI solely for sound detection and showed a mean phoneme discrimination score of 12% (IQR = 0 to 12), while still expressing satisfaction with ambient sound detection. In the USH2 group (N = 23 ears), a long-term mean phoneme score of 85% (IQR = 81 to 95) was found. Better outcomes were associated with younger age at implantation and higher preimplantation speech perception scores. USH3-subjects (N = 7 ears) achieved a mean postimplantation phoneme score of 71% (IQR = 45 to 91).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is currently one of the largest and most comprehensive studies evaluating CI outcomes in individuals with USH, demonstrating that overall, individuals with USH benefit from CI at both short- and long-term follow-up. Due to the considerable variability in phenotype observed among the three subtypes, each subtype was analyzed separately, resulting in smaller sample sizes. For USH1 subjects, optimal CI outcomes are expected with early simultaneous bilateral implantation. Late implantation in USH1 provides signaling function, but achieved speech recognition is insufficient for oral communication. In USH2 and USH3, favorable CI outcomes are expected, especially if individuals exhibit sufficient speech recognition with hearing aids and receive ample auditory stimulation preimplantation. Early implantation is recommended for USH2, given the progressive nature of hearing loss and concomitant severe visual impairment. In comparison with USH2, predicting outcomes in USH3 remains challenging due to the variability found. Counseling for USH2 and USH3 should highlight early implantation benefits and encourage hearing aid use.\nPMID:\n38987893\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001544",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: This study had two objectives: to examine associations between extended high-frequency (EHF) thresholds, demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity), risk factors (cardiovascular, smoking, noise exposure, occupation), and cognitive abilities; and to determine variance explained by EHF thresholds for speech perception in noise, self-rated workload/effort, and self-reported hearing difficulties.\nDESIGN: This study was a retrospective analysis of a data set from the MUSC Longitudinal Cohort Study of Age-related Hearing Loss. Data from 347 middle-aged adults (45 to 64 years) and 694 older adults (≥ 65 years) were analyzed for this study. Speech perception was quantified using low-context Speech Perception In Noise (SPIN) sentences. Self-rated workload/effort was measured using the effort prompt from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index. Self-reported hearing difficulty was assessed using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly/Adults. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task and the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test were used to assess selected cognitive abilities. Pure-tone averages representing conventional and EHF thresholds between 9 and 12 kHz (PTA(9 - 12 kHz)) were utilized in simple linear regression analyses to examine relationships between thresholds and demographic and risk factors or in linear regression models to assess the contributions of PTA(9 - 12 kHz) to the variance among the three outcomes of interest. Further analyses were performed on a subset of individuals with thresholds ≤ 25 dB HL at all conventional frequencies to control for the influence of hearing loss on the association between PTA(9 - 12 kHz) and outcome measures.\nRESULTS: PTA(9 - 12 kHz) was higher in males than females, and was higher in White participants than in racial Minority participants. Linear regression models showed the associations between cardiovascular risk factors and PTA(9 - 12 kHz) were not statistically significant. Older adults who reported a history of noise exposure had higher PTA(9 - 12 kHz) than those without a history, while associations between noise history and PTA(9 - 12 kHz) did not reach statistical significance for middle-aged participants. Linear models adjusting for age, sex, race and noise history showed that higher PTA(9 - 12 kHz) was associated with greater self-perceived hearing difficulty and poorer speech recognition scores in noise for both middle-aged and older participants. Workload/effort was significantly related to PTA(9 - 12 kHz) for middle-aged, but not older, participants, while cognitive task performance was correlated with PTA(9 - 12 kHz) only for older participants. In general, PTA(9 - 12 kHz)did not account for additional variance in outcome measures as compared to conventional pure-tone thresholds, with the exception of self-reported hearing difficulties in older participants. Linear models adjusting for age and accounting for subject-level correlations in the subset analyses revealed no association between PTA(9 - 12 kHz)and outcomes of interest.\nCONCLUSIONS: EHF thresholds show age-, sex-, and race-related patterns of elevation that are similar to what is observed for conventional thresholds. The current results support the need for more research to determine the utility of adding EHF thresholds to routine audiometric assessment with middle-aged and older adults.\nPMID:\n38987892\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001531",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Tinnitus in children and adolescents is relatively unexplored territory. The available literature is limited and the reported prevalence of tinnitus suffering varies widely due to the absence of a definition for pediatric tinnitus. The impact on daily life seems to be lower than in the adult population. It is unclear if children who suffer from tinnitus, like adults, also experience psychological distress like anxiety or depressive symptoms. A better understanding of tinnitus in children and its impact on daily life could provide more insight into the actual size of the problem and could give direction for future studies to investigate the cause of progression of tinnitus.\nDESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed using the Dutch Lifelines population-based cohort of people living in the north of the Netherlands. A total of 4964 children (4 to 12 years of age) and 2506 adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) were included. The presence of tinnitus suffering and behavioral outcomes were assessed with a single-item question and the Child Behavioral Checklist or the Youth Self Report questionnaire respectively. The associations of behavioral outcomes and tinnitus suffering were analyzed using univariate binary regressions.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of tinnitus suffering in children was 3.3 and 12.8% in adolescents. Additionally, 0.3% of the children and 1.9% of the adolescents suffered a lot or extremely of their tinnitus. Externalizing and internalizing problems were associated with tinnitus in adolescents. Internalizing problems were associated with tinnitus in children.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of tinnitus suffering in this sample of the general population is comparable to other population-based studies. A low percentage of children (0.3%) or adolescents (1.9%) suffered a lot or extremely of their tinnitus. Tinnitus suffering is associated with all behavioral outcome subscales in adolescents and with internalizing problems in children, although the effect sizes were very small. Future research should focus on achieving a consensus for the definition of pediatric tinnitus and on the development of a validated outcome measure.\nPMID:\n38982557\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001538",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Evidence continues to emerge of associations between cochlear implant (CI) outcomes and cognitive functions in postlingually deafened adults. While there are multiple factors that appear to affect these associations, the impact of speech recognition background testing conditions (i.e., in quiet versus noise) has not been systematically explored. The two aims of this study were to (1) identify associations between speech recognition following cochlear implantation and performance on cognitive tasks, and to (2) investigate the impact of speech testing in quiet versus noise on these associations. Ultimately, we want to understand the conditions that impact this complex relationship between CI outcomes and cognition.\nDESIGN: A scoping review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was performed on published literature evaluating the relation between outcomes of cochlear implantation and cognition. The current review evaluates 39 papers that reported associations between over 30 cognitive assessments and speech recognition tests in adult patients with CIs. Six cognitive domains were evaluated: Global Cognition, Inhibition-Concentration, Memory and Learning, Controlled Fluency, Verbal Fluency, and Visuospatial Organization. Meta-analysis was conducted on three cognitive assessments among 12 studies to evaluate relations with speech recognition outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify whether speech recognition testing in quiet versus in background noise impacted its association with cognitive performance.\nRESULTS: Significant associations between cognition and speech recognition in a background of quiet or noise were found in 69% of studies. Tests of Global Cognition and Inhibition-Concentration skills resulted in the highest overall frequency of significant associations with speech recognition (45% and 57%, respectively). Despite the modest proportion of significant associations reported, pooling effect sizes across samples through meta-analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between tests of Global Cognition (r = +0.37, p < 0.01) as well as Verbal Fluency (r = +0.44, p < 0.01) and postoperative speech recognition skills. Tests of Memory and Learning are most frequently utilized in the setting of CI (in 26 of 39 included studies), yet meta-analysis revealed nonsignificant associations with speech recognition performance in a background of quiet (r = +0.30, p = 0.18), and noise (r = -0.06, p = 0.78).\nCONCLUSIONS: Background conditions of speech recognition testing may influence the relation between speech recognition outcomes and cognition. The magnitude of this effect of testing conditions on this relationship appears to vary depending on the cognitive construct being assessed. Overall, Global Cognition and Inhibition-Concentration skills are potentially useful in explaining speech recognition skills following cochlear implantation. Future work should continue to evaluate these relations to appropriately unify cognitive testing opportunities in the setting of cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38953851\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001527",

However, no consensus exists on which tests constitute the minimum necessary battery. We assembled an international panel of clinical experts to develop, refine, and vote upon a set of core consensus statements.\nDESIGN: A literature review was used to identify intraoperative tests currently used in the field and draft a set of provisional statements. For statement evaluation and refinement, we used a modified Delphi consensus panel structure. Multiple interactive rounds of voting, evaluation, and feedback were conducted to achieve convergence.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine provisional statements were included in the original draft. In the first voting round, consensus was reached on 15 statements. Of the 14 statements that did not reach consensus, 12 were revised based on feedback provided by the expert practitioners, and 2 were eliminated. In the second voting round, 10 of the 12 revised statements reached a consensus. The two statements which did not achieve consensus were further revised and subjected to a third voting round. However, both statements failed to achieve consensus in the third round.

Children with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing, hearing aid evaluation, or cochlear implant mapping at our tertiary pediatric medical center between January 2018 and December 2021 were included. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify social, demographic, and health factors associated with primary outcomes, defined as age at hearing loss identification, age at intervention (here defined as amplification start), and interval between identification and intervention.\nRESULTS: Of 132 patients included, mean age was 2.4 years, 48% were male, and 51% were Hispanic. There was significant association between each Hispanic ethnicity (p = 0.005, p = 0.04, respectively), insurance type (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively), and later age at identification and intervention. In multivariable analyses, Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with both delays in identification and intervention (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively), and public insurance was associated with delays in intervention (p = 0.01). In addition, the total number of ABRs was significantly associated with both older age of identification and intervention (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Mediator analysis demonstrated that the effect of ethnicity on age at identification is mediated by the total number of ABRs performed.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant association between total number of ABRs and age at identification and intervention for children with hearing loss exists.

This investigation draws on hearing data from 5 to 13 years and again at 45 years of age, to explore the associations between childhood hearing variables and hearing and listening ability at age 45.\nDESIGN: Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between childhood hearing (otological status and mid-frequency pure-tone average) and (a) age 45 peripheral hearing ability (mid-frequency pure-tone average and high-frequency pure-tone average), and (b) age 45 listening ability (listening in spatialized noise and subjective questionnaire on listening experiences). Sex, childhood socioeconomic status, and adult IQ were included in the model as covariates.\nRESULTS: Peripheral hearing and listening abilities at age 45 were consistently associated with childhood hearing acuity at mid-frequencies. Otological status was a moderate predicting factor for high-frequency hearing and utilization of spatial listening cues in adulthood.\nCONCLUSIONS: We aim to use these findings to develop a foundational model of hearing trajectories. This will form the basis for identifying precursors, to be investigated in a subsequent series of analyses, that may protect against or exacerbate hearing-associated cognitive decline in the Dunedin Study cohort as they progress from mid-life to older age.\nPMID:\n38898547\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001542",

To this end, we measured peak pupil dilation (PPD) at a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNR) by systematically changing the noise level at a constant speech level, and vice versa.\nDESIGN: A group of mostly elderly CI users performed the Dutch/Flemish Matrix test in quiet and in multitalker babble at different SNRs. SNRs were set relative to the speech-recognition threshold (SRT), namely at SRT, and 5 and 10 dB above SRT (0 dB, +5 dB, and +10 dB re SRT). The latter 2 conditions were obtained by either varying speech level (at a fixed noise level of 60 dBA) or by varying noise level (with a fixed speech level). We compared these PPDs with those of a group of typical hearing (TH) listeners. In addition, listening effort was assessed with subjective ratings on a Likert scale.\nRESULTS: PPD for the CI group did not significantly depend on SNR, whereas SNR significantly affected PPDs for TH listeners. Subjective effort ratings depended significantly on SNR for both groups. For CI users, PPDs were significantly larger, and effort was rated higher when speech was varied, and noise was fixed for CI users. By contrast, for TH listeners effort ratings were significantly higher and performance scores lower when noise was varied, and speech was fixed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of a significant effect of varying SNR on PPD suggests that the Matrix test may not be a feasible speech test for measuring listening effort with pupillometric measures for CI users. A rating test appeared more promising in this population, corroborating earlier reports that subjective measures may reflect different dimensions of listening effort than pupil dilation. Establishing the SNR by varying speech or noise level can have subtle, but significant effects on measures of listening effort, and these effects can differ between TH listeners and CI users.\nPMID:\n38886888\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001529",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: In clinical and laboratory settings, speech recognition is typically assessed in a way that cannot distinguish accurate auditory perception from misperception that was mentally repaired or inferred from context. Previous work showed that the process of repairing misperceptions elicits greater listening effort, and that this elevated effort lingers well after the sentence is heard. That result suggests that cognitive repair strategies might appear successful when testing a single utterance but fail for everyday continuous conversational speech. The present study tested the hypothesis that the effort of repairing misperceptions has the consequence of carrying over to interfere with perception of later words after the sentence.\nDESIGN: Stimuli were open-set coherent sentences that were presented intact or with a word early in the sentence replaced with noise, forcing the listener to use later context to mentally repair the missing word. Sentences were immediately followed by digit triplets, which served to probe carryover effort from the sentence. Control conditions allowed for the comparison to intact sentences that did not demand mental repair, as well as to listening conditions that removed the need to attend to the post-sentence stimuli, or removed the post-sentence digits altogether. Intelligibility scores for the sentences and digits were accompanied by time-series measurements of pupil dilation to assess cognitive load during the task, as well as subjective rating of effort. Participants included adults with cochlear implants (CIs), as well as an age-matched group and a younger group of listeners with typical hearing for comparison.\nRESULTS: For the CI group, needing to repair a missing word during a sentence resulted in more errors on the digits after the sentence, especially when the repair process did not result in a coherent sensible perception. Sentences that needed repair also contained more errors on the words that were unmasked. All groups showed substantial increase of pupil dilation when sentences required repair, even when the repair was successful. Younger typical hearing listeners showed clear differences in moment-to-moment allocation of effort in the different conditions, while the other groups did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: For CI listeners, the effort of needing to repair misperceptions in a sentence can last long enough to interfere with words that follow the sentence. This pattern could pose a serious problem for regular communication but would go overlooked in typical testing with single utterances, where a listener has a chance to repair misperceptions before responding. Carryover effort was not predictable by basic intelligibility scores, but can be revealed in behavioral data when sentences are followed immediately by extra probe words such as digits.\nPMID:\n38886880\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001537",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Recently, the Noise-Tolerance Domains Test (NTDT) was applied to study the noise-tolerance domains used by young normal-hearing (NH) listeners during noise acceptance decisions. In this study, we examined how subjective speech intelligibility may drive noise acceptance decisions by applying the NTDT on NH and hearing-impaired (HI) listeners at the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) around the Tracking of Noise-Tolerance (TNT) thresholds.\nDESIGN: A single-blind, within-subjects design with 22 NH and 17 HI older adults was followed. Listeners completed the TNT to determine the average noise acceptance threshold (TNTAve). Then, listeners completed the NTDT at the SNRs of 0, ±3 dB (re: TNTAve) to estimate the weighted noise-tolerance domain ratings (WNTDRs) for each domain criterion. Listeners also completed the Objective and Subjective Intelligibility Difference (OSID) Test to establish the individual intelligibility performance-intensity (P-I) functions of the TNT materials. All test measures were conducted at 75 and 82 dB SPL speech input levels. NH and HI listeners were tested in the unaided mode. The HI listeners were also tested using a study hearing aid. The WNTDRs were plotted against subjective speech intelligibilities extrapolated from individual P-I of the OSID at the SNRs corresponding to NTDT test conditions. Listeners were grouped according to their most heavily weighed domain and a regression analysis was performed against listener demographics as well as TNT and OSID performances to determine which variable(s) affected listener grouping.\nRESULTS: Three linear mixed effects (LMEs) models were used to examine whether WNTDRs changed with subjective speech intelligibility. All three LMEs found significant fixed effects of domain criteria, subjective intelligibility, and speech input level on WNTDRs. In general, heavier weights were assigned to speech interference and loudness domains at poorer intelligibility levels (<50%) with reversals to distraction and annoyance at higher intelligibility levels (>80%). The comparison between NH and HI-unaided showed that NH listeners assigned greater weights to loudness than the HI-unaided listeners. The comparison between NH and HI-aided groups showed similar weights between groups. The comparison between HI-unaided and HI-aided found that HI listeners assigned lower weights to speech interference and greater weights to loudness when tested in aided compared with unaided modes. In all comparisons, loudness was weighed heavier at the 82 dB SPL input level than at the 75 dB SPL input level with greater weights to annoyance in the NH versus HI-unaided comparison and lower weights to distraction in the HI-aided versus HI-unaided comparison. A generalized linear model determined that listener grouping was best accounted for by subjective speech intelligibility estimated at TNTAve.\nCONCLUSIONS: The domain criteria used by listeners were driven by their subjective speech intelligibility regardless of their hearing status (i.e., NH versus HI). In general, when subjective intelligibility was poor, the domains of speech interference and loudness were weighed the heaviest. As subjective intelligibility improved, the weightings on annoyance and distraction increased. Furthermore, a listener's criterion for >90% subjective speech understanding at the TNTAve may allow one to profile the listener.\nPMID:\n38880961\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001536",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Listening effort involves the mental effort required to perceive an auditory stimulus, for example in noisy environments. Prolonged increased listening effort, for example due to impaired hearing ability, may increase risk of health complications. It is therefore important to identify valid and sensitive measures of listening effort. Physiological measures have been shown to be sensitive to auditory task demand manipulations and are considered to reflect changes in listening effort. Such measures include pupil dilation, alpha power, skin conductance level, and heart rate variability. The aim of the current systematic review was to provide an overview of studies to listening effort that used multiple physiological measures. The two main questions were: (1) what is the effect of changes in auditory task demand on simultaneously acquired physiological measures from various modalities? and (2) what is the relationship between the responses in these physiological measures?\nDESIGN: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, relevant articles were sought in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science and by examining the references of included articles. Search iterations with different combinations of psychophysiological measures were performed in conjunction with listening effort-related search terms. Quality was assessed using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies.\nRESULTS: A total of 297 articles were identified from three databases, of which 27 were included. One additional article was identified from reference lists. Of the total 28 included articles, 16 included an analysis regarding the relationship between the physiological measures. The overall quality of the included studies was reasonable.\nCONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that most of the physiological measures either show no effect to auditory task demand manipulations or a consistent effect in the expected direction. For example, pupil dilation increased, pre-ejection period decreased, and skin conductance level increased with increasing auditory task demand. Most of the relationships between the responses of these physiological measures were nonsignificant or weak. The physiological measures varied in their sensitivity to auditory task demand manipulations. One of the identified knowledge gaps was that the included studies mostly used tasks with high-performance levels, resulting in an underrepresentation of the physiological changes at lower performance levels. This makes it difficult to capture how the physiological responses behave across the full psychometric curve. Our results support the Framework for Understanding Effortful Listening and the need for a multimodal approach to listening effort. We furthermore discuss focus points for future studies.\nPMID:\n38880960\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001508",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Modern cochlear implants (CIs) use varying-length electrode arrays inserted at varying insertion angles within variably sized cochleae. Thus, there exists an opportunity to enhance CI performance, particularly in postlinguistic adults, by optimizing the frequency-to-place allocation for electrical stimulation, thereby minimizing the need for central adaptation and plasticity. There has been interest in applying Greenwood or Stakhovskaya et al. function (describing the tonotopic map) to postoperative imaging of electrodes to improve frequency allocation and place coding. Acoustically-evoked electrocochleography (ECochG) allows for electrophysiologic best-frequency (BF) determination of CI electrodes and the potential for creating a personalized frequency allocation function. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between early speech-perception performance and frequency-to-place mismatch.\nDESIGN: This retrospective study included 50 patients who received a slim perimodiolar electrode array. Following electrode insertion, five acoustic pure-tone stimuli ranging from 0.25 to 2 kHz were presented, and electrophysiological measurements were collected across all 22 electrode contacts. Cochlear microphonic tuning curves were subsequently generated for each stimulus frequency to ascertain the BF electrode or the location corresponding to the maximum response amplitude. Subsequently, we calculated the difference between the stimulus frequency and the patient's CI map's actual frequency allocation at each BF electrode, reflecting the frequency-to-place mismatch. BF electrocochleography-total response (BF-ECochG-TR), a measure of cochlear health, was also evaluated for each subject to control for the known impact of this measure on performance.\nRESULTS: Our findings showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.23 to 0.76) between the cumulative frequency-to-place mismatch, as determined using the ECochG-derived BF map (utilizing 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz), and 3-month performance on consonant-nucleus-consonant words (N = 38). Larger positive mismatches, shifted basal from the BF map, led to enhanced speech perception. Incorporating BF-ECochG-TR, total mismatch, and their interaction in a multivariate model explained 62% of the variance in consonant-nucleus-consonant word scores at 3 months. BF-ECochG-TR as a standalone predictor tended to overestimate performance for subjects with larger negative total mismatches and underestimated the performance for those with larger positive total mismatches. Neither cochlear diameter, number of cochlear turns, nor apical insertion angle accounted for the variability in total mismatch.\nCONCLUSIONS: Comparison of ECochG-BF derived tonotopic electrode maps to the frequency allocation tables reveals substantial mismatch, explaining 26.0% of the variability in CI performance in quiet. Closer examination of the mismatch shows that basally shifted maps at high frequencies demonstrate superior performance at 3 months compared with those with apically shifted maps (toward Greenwood and Stakhovskaya et al.). The implications of these results suggest that electrophysiological-based frequency reallocation might lead to enhanced speech-perception performance, especially when compared with conventional manufacturer maps or anatomic-based mapping strategies. Future research, exploring the prospective use of ECochG-based mapping techniques for frequency allocation is underway.\nPMID:\n38880958\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001528",

In particular, linguistic context allows the use of several cognitive mechanisms that are not well distinguished in hearing science, namely those relating to \"postdiction\", \"integration\", and \"prediction\". We offer the perspective that an unacknowledged impact of hearing loss is the differential use of predictive mechanisms relative to age-matched individuals with normal hearing. As evidence, we first review how degraded auditory input leads to reduced prediction in people with normal hearing, then consider the literature exploring context use in people with acquired postlingual hearing loss. We argue that no research on hearing loss has directly assessed prediction. Because current interventions for hearing do not fully alleviate difficulty in conversation, and avoidance of spoken social interaction may be a mediator between hearing loss and cognitive decline, this perspective could lead to greater understanding of cognitive effects of hearing loss and provide insight regarding new targets for intervention.\nPMID:\n38880953\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001515",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Recently, the HEAR-aware app was developed to support adults who are eligible for hearing aids (HAs) but not yet ready to use them. The app serves as a self-management tool, offering assistance for a range of target behaviors (TBs), such as communication strategies and emotional coping. Using ecological momentary assessment and intervention, the app prompts users to complete brief surveys regarding challenging listening situations they encounter in their daily lives (ecological momentary assessment). In response, users receive educational content in the form of \"snippets\" (videos, texts, web links) on the TBs, some of which are customized based on the reported acoustic environmental characteristics (ecological momentary intervention). The primary objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the HEAR-aware app in enhancing readiness to take action on various TBs and evaluate its impact on secondary outcomes. The secondary objective was to examine the app's usability, usefulness, and user satisfaction.\nMETHODS: A randomized controlled trial design with two arms was used. Participants with hearing loss aged 50 years and over were recruited via an HA retailer and randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 42, mean age = 65 years [SD = 9.1]) or the control group (n = 45, mean age = 68 years [SD 8.7]). The intervention group used the app during 4 weeks. The control group received no intervention. All participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1), and again 4 weeks later (T2). Participants' readiness to take action on five TBs was measured with The Line Composite. A list of secondary outcomes was used. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using Linear Mixed effect Models including group (intervention/control), time (T0/T1/T2), and Group × Time Interactions. In addition, a per protocol analysis was carried out to explore whether effects depended on app usage. For the secondary aim the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, item 4 of the International Outcome Inventory-Alternative Intervention (IOI-AI), and a recommendation item were used (intervention group only at T1).\nRESULTS: For objective 1, there was no significant group difference for The Line Composite over the course of T0, T1, and T2. However, a significant (p = 0.033) Group × Time Interaction was found for The Line Emotional coping, with higher increase in readiness to take action on emotional coping in the intervention group than in the control group. The intention-to-treat analyses revealed no other significant group differences, but the per protocol analyses showed that participants in the intervention group were significantly more ready to take up Assistive Listening Devices (The Line Assistive Listening Devices) and less ready to take up HAs (Staging Algorithm HAs) than the control group (p = 0.049). Results for objective 2 showed that on average, participants rated the app as moderately useful (mean Intrinsic Motivation Inventory score 5 out of 7) and its usability as \"marginal\" (mean SUS score 68 out of 100) with about half of the participants rating the app as \"good\" (SUS score >70) and a minority rating is as \"unacceptable\" (SUS score ≤50).\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of self-management support tools like the HEAR-aware app in the rehabilitation of adults with hearing loss who are not yet ready for HAs. The range in usability scores suggest that it may not be a suitable intervention for everyone.\nPMID:\n38831480\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001533",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Speech recognition in cochlear implant (CI) recipients is quite variable, particularly in challenging listening conditions. Demographic, audiological, and cognitive factors explain some, but not all, of this variance. The literature suggests that rapid auditory perceptual learning explains unique variance in speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and those with hearing loss. The present study focuses on the early adaptation phase of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning. It investigates whether adult CI recipients exhibit this learning and, if so, whether it accounts for portions of the variance in their recognition of fast speech and speech in noise.\nDESIGN: Thirty-six adult CI recipients (ages = 35 to 77, M = 55) completed a battery of general speech recognition tests (sentences in speech-shaped noise, four-talker babble noise, and natural-fast speech), cognitive measures (vocabulary, working memory, attention, and verbal processing speed), and a rapid auditory perceptual learning task with time-compressed speech. Accuracy in the general speech recognition tasks was modeled with a series of generalized mixed models that accounted for demographic, audiological, and cognitive factors before accounting for the contribution of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning of time-compressed speech.\nRESULTS: Most CI recipients exhibited early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning of time-compressed speech within the course of the first 20 sentences. This early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning had unique contribution to the recognition of natural-fast speech in quiet and speech in noise, although the contribution to natural-fast speech may reflect the rapid learning that occurred in this task. When accounting for demographic and cognitive characteristics, an increase of 1 SD in the early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning rate was associated with ~52% increase in the odds of correctly recognizing natural-fast speech in quiet, and ~19% to 28% in the odds of correctly recognizing the different types of speech in noise. Age, vocabulary, attention, and verbal processing speed also had unique contributions to general speech recognition. However, their contribution varied between the different general speech recognition tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous findings in other populations, in CI recipients, early task-specific rapid auditory perceptual, learning also accounts for some of the individual differences in the recognition of speech in noise and natural-fast speech in quiet. Thus, across populations, the early rapid adaptation phase of task-specific rapid auditory perceptual learning might serve as a skill that supports speech recognition in various adverse conditions. In CI users, the ability to rapidly adapt to ongoing acoustical challenges may be one of the factors associated with good CI outcomes. Overall, CI recipients with higher cognitive resources and faster rapid learning rates had better speech recognition.\nPMID:\n38829780\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001523",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Objective estimation of minimum hearing levels using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) elicited by single frequency tone-bursts presented monaurally is currently considered the gold standard. However, the data acquisition time to estimate thresholds (for both ears across four audiometric frequencies) using this method usually exceeds the sleep time (ranging between 35 and 49 minutes) in infants below 4 months, thus providing incomplete information of hearing status which in turn delays timely clinical intervention. Alternate approaches using faster rate, or tone-burst trains have not been readily accepted due to additional hardware and software requirements. We propose here a novel binaural multifrequency stimulation paradigm wherein several stimuli of different frequencies are presented binaurally in an interleaved manner. The rationale here is that the proposed paradigm will increase acquisition efficiency, significantly reduce test time, and improve accuracy by incorporating an automatic wave V detection algorithm. It is important to note that this paradigm can be easily implemented in most commercial ABR systems currently used by most clinicians.\nDESIGN: Using this binaural multifrequency paradigm, ear specific ABRs were recorded in 30 normal-hearing young adults to both tone-bursts, and narrow-band (NB) iChirps at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. Comparison of ABRs elicited by tone-bursts and narrow-band chirps allowed us to determine if NB iChirps elicited a more robust wave V component compared with the tone-bursts. ABR data were characterized by measures of minimum hearing levels; wave V amplitude; and response detectability for two electrode configurations (high forehead-C7; and high forehead-linked mastoids).\nRESULTS: Consistent with the research literature, wave V response amplitudes were relatively more robust for NB iChirp stimuli compared with tone-burst stimuli. The easier identification and better detectability of wave V for the NB iChirps at lower stimulus levels contributed to their better thresholds compared with tone-burst elicited responses. It is important to note that binaural multifrequency hearing levels close to minimum hearing levels were determined in approximately 22 minutes using this paradigm-appreciably quicker than the 45 to 60 minutes or longer time required for threshold determination using the conventional single frequency method.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our novel and simple paradigm using either NB iChirps or tone-bursts provides a reliable method to rapidly estimate the minimum hearing levels across audiometric frequencies for both ears. Incorporation of an automatic wave V detection algorithm increases objectivity and further reduce test time and facilitate early hearing identification and intervention.\nPMID:\n38825740\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001535",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Assessing listening difficulties and associated complaints can be challenging. Often, measures of peripheral auditory functions are within normal ranges, making clinicians feel unsure about proper management strategies. The range and nature of observed or experienced difficulties might be better captured using a qualitative measure. The Evaluation of Children's Listening and Processing Skills (ECLiPS) questionnaire was designed to broadly profile the auditory and cognitive problems often present in children with listening difficulties. This 38-item questionnaire was initially standardized in British children aged 6 to 11 years, was subsequently modified for use with North-American children, and was recently translated into Flemish-Dutch. This study aimed to compare typical scores of the Flemish version with the UK and US versions, and to evaluate and compare its psychometric quality based on Rasch analysis.\nDESIGN: We selected 112 Flemish children aged 6 to 11 years with verified normal hearing and typical development, and asked two caregivers of every child to fill out the ECLiPS. Data from two comparator samples were analyzed, including responses for 71 North-American children and 650 British children. Typical values for ECLiPS factors and aggregates were determined as a function of age and gender, and meaningful differences across samples were analyzed. Rasch analyses were performed to evaluate whether ECLiPS response categories work as intended, and whether item scores fit a linear equal interval measurement scale that works the same way for everyone. Item and person metrics were derived, including separation and reliability indices. We investigated whether items function similarly across linguistically and culturally different samples.\nRESULTS: ECLiPS scores were relatively invariant to age. Girls obtained higher scores compared with boys, mainly for items related to memory and attention, and pragmatic and social skills. Across ECLiPS versions, the most pronounced differences were found for items probing social skills. With respect to its psychometric quality, ECLiPS response categories work as intended, and ECLiPS items were found to fit the Rasch measurement scale. Cultural differences in responses were noted for some items, belonging to different factors. Item separation and reliability indices generally pointed toward sufficient variation in item difficulty. In general, person separation (and reliability) metrics, quantifying the instrument's ability to distinguish between poor and strong performers (in a reproducible manner), were low. This is expected from samples of typically developing children with homogeneous and high levels of listening ability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Across the languages assessed here, the ECLiPS caregiver questionnaire was verified to be a psychometrically valid qualitative measure to assess listening and processing skills, which can be used to support the assessment and management of elementary school children referred with LiD.\nPMID:\n38825739\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001509",

Nationally representative datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 2011 to 2012, 2015 to 2016, and 2017 to 2020, the three most recent NHANES datasets with audiological information, were used.\nRESULTS: The NHANES datasets indicated that there are 49.5 million adults in the United States with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing trouble. Results indicated that OTC hearing-aid candidates are most frequently 50 to 69 years of age, married, and identify as non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity. Most of these individuals graduated from high school, had several risk factors for hearing loss, had not had a hearing test in the past 5 years, and had never used hearing aids or assistive listening devices previously. The typical audiometric profile was a bilaterally symmetrical sloping hearing loss with slight to mild hearing loss above 2000 Hz. Group data showed normal immittance measures and absence of otoscopic abnormalities except for the presence of excessive (not impacted) cerumen in about 13% of the OTC hearing-aid candidates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tens of millions of US adults have perceived mild-to-moderate hearing trouble but have not pursued assistance, either through obtaining a hearing test or acquiring prescription hearing aids.\nPMID:\n38816904\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001514",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe discovery and development of electrocochleography (ECochG) in animal models has been fundamental for its implementation in clinical audiology and neurotology. In our laboratory, the use of round-window ECochG recordings in chinchillas has allowed a better understanding of auditory efferent functioning. In previous works, we gave evidence of the corticofugal modulation of auditory-nerve and cochlear responses during visual attention and working memory. However, whether these cognitive top-down mechanisms to the most peripheral structures of the auditory pathway are also active during audiovisual crossmodal stimulation is unknown. Here, we introduce a new technique, wireless ECochG to record compound-action potentials of the auditory nerve (CAP), cochlear microphonics (CM), and round-window noise (RWN) in awake chinchillas during a paradigm of crossmodal (visual and auditory) stimulation. We compared ECochG data obtained from four awake chinchillas recorded with a wireless ECochG system with wired ECochG recordings from six anesthetized animals. Although ECochG experiments with the wireless system had a lower signal-to-noise ratio than wired recordings, their quality was sufficient to compare ECochG potentials in awake crossmodal conditions. We found non-significant differences in CAP and CM amplitudes in response to audiovisual stimulation compared to auditory stimulation alone (clicks and tones). On the other hand, spontaneous auditory-nerve activity (RWN) was modulated by visual crossmodal stimulation, suggesting that visual crossmodal simulation can modulate spontaneous but not evoked auditory-nerve activity. However, given the limited sample of 10 animals (4 wireless and 6 wired), these results should be interpreted cautiously. Future experiments are required to substantiate these conclusions. In addition, we introduce the use of wireless ECochG in animal models as a useful tool for translational research.\nPMID:\n39094370\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109093",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nMusicians are at risk of hearing loss and tinnitus due to regular exposure to high levels of noise. This level of risk may have been underestimated previously since damage to the auditory system, such as cochlear synaptopathy, may not be easily detectable using standard clinical measures. Most previous research investigating hearing loss in musicians has involved cross-sectional study designs that may capture only a snapshot of hearing health in relation to noise exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cumulative noise exposure on behavioural, electrophysiological, and self-report indices of hearing damage in early-career musicians and non-musicians with normal hearing over a 2-year period. Participants completed an annual test battery consisting of pure tone audiometry, extended high-frequency hearing thresholds, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), speech perception in noise, auditory brainstem responses, and self-report measures of tinnitus, hyperacusis, and hearing in background noise. Participants also completed the Noise Exposure Structured Interview to estimate cumulative noise exposure across the study period. Linear mixed models assessed changes over time. The longitudinal analysis comprised 64 early-career musicians (female n = 34; age range at T0 = 18-26 years) and 30 non-musicians (female n = 20; age range at T0 = 18-27 years). There were few longitudinal changes as a result of musicianship. Small improvements over time in some measures may be attributable to a practice/test-retest effect. Some measures (e.g., DPOAE indices of outer hair cell function) were associated with noise exposure at each time point, but did not show a significant change over time. A small proportion of participants reported a worsening of their tinnitus symptoms, which participants attributed to noise exposure, or not using hearing protection. Future longitudinal studies should attempt to capture the effects of noise exposure over a longer period, taken at several time points, for a precise measure of how hearing changes over time. Hearing conservation programmes for \"at risk\" individuals should closely monitor DPOAEs to detect early signs of noise-induced hearing loss when audiometric thresholds are clinically normal.\nPMID:\n39084132\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109077",

A new mouse allele, Sgms1\ntm1a\n, unexpectedly showed normal Auditory Brainstem Response thresholds. We found that the Sgms1\ntm1a\nmutation led to incomplete knockdown of transcript to 20 % of normal values, which was enough to support normal hearing. The Sgms1\ntm1b\nallele was generated by knocking out exon 7, leading to a complete lack of detectable transcript in the inner ear. Sgms1\ntm1b\nhomozygotes showed largely normal auditory brainstem response thresholds at first, followed by progressive loss of sensitivity until they showed severe impairment at 6 months old. The endocochlear potential was consistently reduced in Sgms1\ntm1b\nmutants at 3, 4 and 8 weeks old, to around 80 mV compared with around 120 mV in control littermates. The stria vascularis showed a characteristic irregularity of marginal cell surfaces and patchy loss of Kcnq1 expression at their apical membrane, and expression analysis of the lateral wall suggested that marginal cells were the most likely initial site of dysfunction in the mutants.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nMusicians perform better than non-musicians on a variety of non-musical sound-perception tasks. Whether that musicians' advantage extends to spatial hearing is a topic of increasing interest. Here we investigated one facet of that topic by assessing musicians' and non-musicians' sensitivity to the two primary cues to sound-source location on the horizontal plane: interaural-level-differences (ILDs) and interaural-time-differences (ITDs). Specifically, we measured discrimination thresholds for ILDs at 4 kHz (n =246) and ITDs at 0.5 kHz (n = 137) in participants whose musical-training histories covered a wide range of lengths, onsets, and offsets. For ILD discrimination, when only musical-training length was considered in the analysis, no musicians' advantage was apparent. However, when thresholds were compared between subgroups of non-musicians (<2 years of training) and extreme musicians (≥10 years of training, started ≤ age 7, still playing) a musicians' advantage emerged. Threshold comparisons between the extreme musicians and other subgroups of highly trained musicians (≥10 years of training) further indicated that the advantage required both starting young and continuing to play. In addition, the advantage was larger in males than in females, by some measures, and was not evident in an assessment of learning. For ITD discrimination, in contrast to ILD discrimination, parallel analyses revealed no apparent musicians' advantage. The results suggest that musicianship is associated with greater sensitivity to ILDs, a fundamental sound-localization cue, even though that sensitivity is not central to music, that this musicians' advantage arises, at least in part, from nurture, and that it is governed by a neural substrate where ILDs are processed separately from, and more malleably than, ITDs.\nPMID:\n39053298\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109078",

This phenomenon is particularly significant in individuals with deafness, as the brain adapts to compensate for the lack of auditory stimulation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether cochlear implantation can restore a normal pattern of brain activation following auditory stimulation in cases of asymmetric hearing loss. We used a PET-scan technique to assess brain activity after cochlear implantation, specifically during an auditory voice/non-voice discrimination task. The results indicated a nearly normal pattern of brain activity during the auditory discrimination task, except for increased activation in areas related to attentional processes compared to controls. Additionally, brain activity at rest showed significant changes in implanted participants, including cross modal visuo-auditory processing. Therefore, cochlear implants can restore the brain's activation pattern through long-term adaptive adjustments in intrinsic brain activity.\nPMID:\n39053297\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109079",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVE: The acoustic change complex (ACC) is a cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) and can be elicited by a change in an otherwise continuous sound. The ACC has been highlighted as a promising tool in the assessment of sound and speech discrimination capacity, and particularly for difficult-to-test populations such as infants with hearing loss, due to the objective nature of ACC measurements. Indeed, there is a pressing need to develop further means to accurately and thoroughly establish the hearing status of children with hearing loss, to help guide hearing interventions in a timely manner. Despite the potential of the ACC method, ACC measurements remain relatively rare in a standard clinical settings. The objective of this study was to perform an up-to-date systematic review on ACC measurements in children, to provide greater clarity and consensus on the possible methodologies, applications, and performance of this technique, and to facilitate its uptake in relevant clinical settings.\nDESIGN: Original peer-reviewed articles conducting ACC measurements in children (< 18 years). Data were extracted and summarised for: (1) participant characteristics; (2) ACC methods and auditory stimuli; (3) information related to the performance of the ACC technique; (4) ACC measurement outcomes, advantages, and challenges. The systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines for reporting and the methodological quality of included articles was assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 28 studies were identified (9 infant studies). Review results show that ACC responses can be measured in infants (from < 3 months), and there is evidence of age-dependency, including increased robustness of the ACC response with increasing childhood age. Clinical applications include the measurement of the neural capacity for speech and non-speech sound discrimination in children with hearing loss, auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). Additionally, ACCs can be recorded in children with hearing aids, auditory brainstem implants, and cochlear implants, and ACC results may guide hearing intervention/rehabilitation strategies. The review identified that the time taken to perform ACC measurements was often lengthy; the development of more efficient ACC test procedures for children would be beneficial. Comparisons between objective ACC measurements and behavioural measures of sound discrimination showed significant correlations for some, but not all, included studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: ACC measurements of the neural capacity to discriminate between speech and non-speech sounds are feasible in infants and children, and a wide range of possible clinical applications exist, although more time-efficient procedures would be advantageous for clinical uptake. A consideration of age and maturational effects is recommended, and further research is required to investigate the relationship between objective ACC measures and behavioural measures of sound and speech perception for effective clinical implementation.\nPMID:\n39047579\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109090",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nCombining a cochlear implant with contralateral acoustic hearing typically enhances speech understanding, although this improvement varies among CI users and can lead to an interference effect. This variability may be associated with the effectiveness of the integration between electric and acoustic stimulation, which might be affected by the temporal mismatch between the two listening sides. Finding methods to compensate for the temporal mismatch might contribute to the optimal adjustment of bimodal devices and to improve hearing in CI users with contralateral acoustic hearing. The current study investigates cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) in normal hearing listeners (NH) and CI users with contralateral acoustic hearing. In NH, the amplitude of the N1 peak and the maximum phase locking value (PLV) were analyzed under monaural, binaural, and binaural temporally mismatched conditions. In CI users, CAEPs were measured when listening with CI only (CIS_only), acoustically only (AS_only) and with both sides together (CIS+AS). When listening with CIS+AS, various interaural delays were introduced between the electric and acoustic stimuli. In NH listeners, interaural temporal mismatch resulted in decreased N1 amplitude and PLV. Moreover, PLV is suggested as a more sensitive measure to investigate the integration of information between the two listening sides. CI users showed varied N1 latencies between the AS_only and CIS_only listening conditions, with increased N1 amplitude when the temporal mismatch was compensated. A tendency towards increased PLV was also observed, however, to a lesser extent than in NH listeners, suggesting a limited integration between electric and acoustic stimulation. This work highlights the potential of CAEPs measurement to investigate cortical processing of the information between two listening sides in NH and bimodal CI users.\nPMID:\n39032483\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109088",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nMany children with profound hearing loss have received cochlear implants (CI) to help restore some sense of hearing. There is, however, limited research on long-term neurocognitive outcomes in young adults who have grown up hearing through a CI. This study compared the cognitive outcomes of early-implanted (n = 20) and late-implanted (n = 21) young adult CI users, and typically hearing (TH) controls (n=56), all of whom were enrolled in college. Cognitive fluidity, nonverbal intelligence, and American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension were assessed, revealing no significant differences in cognition and nonverbal intelligence between the early and late-implanted groups. However, there was a difference in ASL comprehension, with the late-implanted group having significantly higher ASL comprehension. Although young adult CI users showed significantly lower scores in a working memory and processing speed task than TH age-matched controls, there were no significant differences in tasks involving executive function shifting, inhibitory control, and episodic memory between young adult CI and young adult TH participants. In an exploratory analysis of a subset of CI participants (n = 17) in whom we were able to examine crossmodal plasticity, we saw greater evidence of crossmodal recruitment from the visual system in late-implanted compared with early-implanted CI young adults. However, cortical visual evoked potential latency biomarkers of crossmodal plasticity were not correlated with cognitive measures or ASL comprehension. The results suggest that in the late-implanted CI users, early access to sign language may have served as a scaffold for appropriate cognitive development, while in the early-implanted group early access to oral language benefited cognitive development. Furthermore, our results suggest that the persistence of crossmodal neuroplasticity into adulthood does not necessarily impact cognitive development. In conclusion, early access to language - spoken or signed - may be important for cognitive development, with no observable effect of crossmodal plasticity on cognitive outcomes.\nPMID:\n39018768\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109074",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nAuditory masking methods originally employed to assess behavioral frequency selectivity have evolved over the years to infer cochlear tuning. Behavioral forward masking thresholds for spectrally notched noise maskers and a fixed, low-level probe tone provide accurate estimates of cochlear tuning. Here, we use this method to investigate the effect of stimulus duration on human cochlear tuning at 500 Hz and 4 kHz. Probes were 20-ms sinusoids at 10 dB sensation level. Maskers were noises with a spectral notch symmetrically and asymmetrically placed around the probe frequency. For seven participants with normal hearing, masker levels at masking threshold were measured in forward masking for various notch widths and for masker durations of 30 and 400 ms. Measurements were fitted assuming rounded exponential filter shapes and the power spectrum model of masking, and equivalent rectangular bandwidths (ERBs) were inferred from the fits. At 4 kHz, masker thresholds were higher for the shorter maskers but ERBs were not significantly different for the two masker durations (ERB\n30ms\n=294 Hz vs. ERB\n400ms\n=277 Hz). At 500 Hz, by contrast, notched-noise curves were shallower for the 30-ms than the 400-ms masker, and ERBs were significantly broader for the shorter masker (ERB\n30ms\n=126 Hz vs. ERB\n400ms\n=55 Hz). We discuss possible factors that may underlay the duration effect at low frequencies and argue that it may not be possible to fully control for those factors. We conclude that tuning estimates are not affected by maker duration at high frequencies but should be measured and interpreted with caution at low frequencies.\nPMID:\n39004016\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109080",

We assess whether auditory cognitive ability, in particular short-term memory for sound features, contributes to both. We examined how auditory memory for fundamental sound features, the carrier frequency and amplitude modulation rate of modulated white noise, contributes to SIN perception. We assessed SIN in 153 healthy participants with varying degrees of hearing loss using measures that require single-digit perception (the Digits-in-Noise, DIN) and sentence perception (Speech-in-Babble, SIB). Independent variables were auditory memory and a range of other factors including the Pure Tone Audiogram (PTA), a measure of dichotic pitch-in-noise perception (Huggins pitch), and demographic variables including age and sex. Multiple linear regression models were compared using Bayesian Model Comparison. The best predictor model for DIN included PTA and Huggins pitch (r\n2\n= 0.32, p < 0.001), whereas the model for SIB included the addition of auditory memory for sound features (r\n2\n= 0.24, p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that auditory memory also explained a significant portion of the variance (28 %) in scores for a screening cognitive test for dementia. Auditory memory for non-speech sounds may therefore provide an important predictor of both SIN and cognitive ability.\nPMID:\n39004015\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109081",

Successful prediction of formal (e.g., type) and temporal sound characteristics facilitates the filtering of irrelevant information, also labelled as 'sensory gating' (SG). Here, we explored if and how parallel manipulations of formal prediction violations and temporal predictability affect SG in persons with and without tinnitus. Age-, education- and sex-matched persons with and without tinnitus (N = 52) participated and listened to paired-tone oddball sequences, varying in formal (standard vs. deviant pitch) and temporal predictability (isochronous vs. random timing). EEG was recorded from 128 channels and data were analyzed by means of temporal spatial principal component analysis (tsPCA). SG was assessed by amplitude suppression for the 2nd tone in a pair and was observed in P50-like activity in both timing conditions and groups. Correspondingly, deviants elicited overall larger amplitudes than standards. However, only persons without tinnitus displayed a larger N100-like deviance response in the isochronous compared to the random timing condition. This result might imply that persons with tinnitus do not benefit similarly as persons without tinnitus from temporal predictability in deviance processing. Thus, persons with tinnitus might display less temporal sensitivity in auditory processing than persons without tinnitus.\nPMID:\n38996530\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109073",

Data were collected from 20 children with prelingual SSD who received a CI before the age of 2.5 years, from the initial activation of the sound processor until the children were 4.8 to 11.0 years old. Daily device use was extracted from the CI's data logging, while word perception in quiet was assessed using direct audio input to the children's sound processor. The children's caregivers completed a questionnaire about habits, motivations, and barriers to device use. The children with SSD and a CI used their device on average 8.3 h per day, corresponding to 63 % of their time spent awake. All children except one could understand speech through the CI, with an average score of 59 % on a closed-set test and 73 % on an open-set test. More device use was associated with higher speech perception scores. Parents were happy with their decision to pursue a CI for their child. Certain habits, like taking off the sound processor during illness, were associated with lower device use. Providing timely counselling to the children's parents, focused on SSD-specific challenges, may be helpful to improve daily device use in these children.\nPMID:\n38991628\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109076",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nContemporary cochlear implants (CIs) use cathodic-leading symmetric biphasic (C-BP) pulses for electrical stimulation. It remains unclear whether asymmetric pulses emphasizing the anodic or cathodic phase may improve spectral and temporal coding with CIs. This study tested place- and temporal-pitch sensitivity with C-BP, anodic-centered triphasic (A-TP), and cathodic-centered triphasic (C-TP) pulse trains on apical, middle, and basal electrodes in 10 implanted ears. Virtual channel ranking (VCR) thresholds (for place-pitch sensitivity) were measured at both a low and a high pulse rate of 99 (Experiment 1) and 1000 (Experiment 2) pulses per second (pps), and amplitude modulation frequency ranking (AMFR) thresholds (for temporal-pitch sensitivity) were measured at a 1000-pps pulse rate in Experiment 3. All stimuli were presented in monopolar mode. Results of all experiments showed that detection thresholds, most comfortable levels (MCLs), VCR thresholds, and AMFR thresholds were higher on more basal electrodes. C-BP pulses had longer active phase duration and thus lower detection thresholds and MCLs than A-TP and C-TP pulses. Compared to C-TP pulses, A-TP pulses had lower detection thresholds at the 99-pps but not the 1000-pps pulse rate, and had lower MCLs at both pulse rates. A-TP pulses led to lower VCR thresholds than C-BP pulses, and in turn than C-TP pulses, at the 1000-pps pulse rate. However, pulse shape did not affect VCR thresholds at the 99-pps pulse rate (possibly due to the fixed temporal pitch) or AMFR thresholds at the 1000-pps pulse rate (where the overall high performance may have reduced the changes with different pulse shapes). Notably, stronger polarity effect on VCR thresholds (or more improvement in VCR with A-TP than with C-TP pulses) at the 1000-pps pulse rate was associated with stronger polarity effect on detection thresholds at the 99-pps pulse rate (consistent with more degeneration of auditory nerve peripheral processes). The results suggest that A-TP pulses may improve place-pitch sensitivity or spectral coding for CI users, especially in situations with peripheral process degeneration.\nPMID:\n38986164\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109075",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nCholinergic signaling is essential to mediate the auditory prepulse inhibition (PPI), an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, that refers to the reduction of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) when a low-intensity, non-startling acoustic stimulus (the prepulse) is presented just before the onset of the acoustic startle stimulus. The cochlear root neurons (CRNs) are the first cells of the ASR circuit to receive cholinergic inputs from non-olivocochlear neurons of the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) and subsequently decrease their neuronal activity in response to auditory prepulses. Yet, the contribution of the VNTB-CRNs pathway to the mediation of PPI has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we used the immunotoxin anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-saporin as well as electrolytic lesions of the medial olivocochlear bundle to selectively eliminate cholinergic VNTB neurons, and then assessed the ASR and PPI paradigms. Retrograde track-tracing experiments were conducted to precisely determine the site of lesioning VNTB neurons projecting to the CRNs. Additionally, the effects of VNTB lesions and the integrity of the auditory pathway were evaluated via auditory brain responses tests, ChAT- and FOS-immunohistochemistry. Consequently, we established three experimental groups: 1) intact control rats (non-lesioned), 2) rats with bilateral lesions of the olivocochlear bundle (OCB-lesioned), and 3) rats with bilateral immunolesions affecting both the olivocochlear bundle and the VNTB (OCB/VNTB-lesioned). All experimental groups underwent ASR and PPI tests at several interstimulus intervals before the lesion and 7, 14, and 21 days after it. Our results show that the ASR amplitude remained unaffected both before and after the lesion across all experimental groups, suggesting that the VNTB does not contribute to the ASR. The%PPI increased across the time points of evaluation in the control and OCB-lesioned groups but not in the OCB/VNTB-lesioned group. At the ISI of 50 ms, the OCB-lesioned group exhibited a significant increase in%PPI (p < 0.01), which did not occur in the OCB/VNTB-lesioned group. Therefore, the ablation of cholinergic non-olivocochlear neurons in the OCB/VNTB-lesioned group suggests that these neurons contribute to the mediation of auditory PPI at the 50 ms ISI through their cholinergic projections to CRNs. Our study strongly reinforces the notion that auditory PPI encompasses a complex mechanism of top-down cholinergic modulation, effectively attenuating the ASR across different interstimulus intervals within multiple pathways.\nPMID:\n38972084\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109070",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nFollowing adult-onset hearing impairment, crossmodal plasticity can occur within various sensory cortices, often characterized by increased neural responses to visual stimulation in not only the auditory cortex, but also in the visual and audiovisual cortices. In the present study, we used an established model of loud noise exposure in rats to examine, for the first time, whether the crossmodal plasticity in the audiovisual cortex that occurs following a relatively mild degree of hearing loss emerges solely from altered intracortical processing or if thalamocortical changes also contribute to the crossmodal effects. Using a combination of an established pharmacological 'cortical silencing' protocol and current source density analysis of the laminar activity recorded across the layers of the audiovisual cortex (i.e., the lateral extrastriate visual cortex, V2L), we observed layer-specific changes post-silencing in the strength of the residual visual, but not auditory, input in the noise exposed rats with mild hearing loss compared to rats with normal hearing. Furthermore, based on a comparison of the laminar profiles pre- versus post-silencing in both groups, we can conclude that noise exposure caused a re-allocation of the strength of visual inputs across the layers of the V2L cortex, including enhanced visual-evoked activity in the granular layer; findings consistent with thalamocortical plasticity. Finally, we confirmed that audiovisual integration within the V2L cortex depends on intact processing within intracortical circuits, and that this form of multisensory processing is vulnerable to disruption by noise-induced hearing loss. Ultimately, the present study furthers our understanding of the contribution of intracortical and thalamocortical processing to crossmodal plasticity as well as to audiovisual integration under both normal and mildly-impaired hearing conditions.\nPMID:\n38941694\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109071",

Aims of the present study were to: 1) identify bilateral responses to envelope and spectral components of a speech syllable using the frequency-following response (FFR), 2) determine if abnormalities in the bilateral FFR occur in children with hearing loss, and 3) assess functional consequences of abnormal bilateral FFR responses on perception of binaural timing cues.\nMETHODS: A single-syllable speech stimulus (/dα/) was presented to each ear individually and bilaterally. Participants were 9 children with normal hearing (M\nAge\n= 12.1 ± 2.5 years) and 6 children with bilateral hearing loss who were experienced bilateral hearing aid users (M\nAge\n= 14.0 ± 2.6 years). FFR temporal and spectral peak amplitudes were compared between listening conditions and groups using linear mixed model regression analyses. Behavioral sensitivity to binaural cues were measured by lateralization responses as coming from the right or left side of the head.\nRESULTS: Both temporal and spectral peaks in FFR responses increased in amplitude in the bilateral compared to unilateral listening conditions in children with normal hearing. These measures of \"bilateral advantage\" were reduced in the group of children with bilateral hearing loss and associated with decreased sensitivity to interaural timing differences.\nCONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that bilateral responses in both temporal and spectral domains can be measured in children using the FFR and is altered in children with hearing loss with consequences to binaural hearing.\nPMID:\n38936172\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109068",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nHearing impairment is the most prevalent sensory disease in humans and can have dramatic effects on the development, and preservation, of our cognitive abilities and social interactions. Currently 20 % of the world's population suffer from a form of hearing impairment; this is predicted to rise to 25 % by 2050. Despite this staggering disease load, and the vast damage it inflicts on the social, medical and economic fabric of humankind, our ability to predict, or prevent, the loss of hearing is very poor indeed. We here make the case for a paradigm shift in our approach to studying deafness. By exploiting more forcefully the molecular-genetic conservation between human hearing and hearing in morphologically distinct models, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we believe, a deeper understanding of hearing and deafness can be achieved. An understanding that moves beyond the surface of the 'deafness genes' to probe the underlying bedrock of hearing, which is shared across taxa, and partly shared across modalities. When it comes to understanding the workings (and failings) of human sensory function, a simple fruit fly has a lot to offer and a fly eye might sometimes be a powerful model for a human ear. Particularly the use of fly avatars, in which specific molecular (genetic or proteomic) states of humans (e.g. specific patients) are experimentally reproduced, in order to study the corresponding molecular mechanisms (e.g. specific diseases) in a controlled yet naturalistic environment, is a tool that promises multiple unprecedented insights. The use of the fly - and fly avatars - would benefit humans and will help enhance the power of other scientific models, such as the mouse.\nPMID:\n38896942\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109047",

However, studies with interaural phase modulation of pure tones showed that IC neurons have a sensitivity to changes in ITD that is not present at the level of the brainstem. This sensitivity has been interpreted as a form of sensitivity to motion. A new type of stimulus is used here to study the sensitivity of IC neurons to dynamic changes in ITD, in which broad- or narrowband stimuli are swept through a range of ITDs with arbitrary start-ITD, end-ITD, speed, and direction. Extracellular recordings were obtained under barbiturate anesthesia in the cat. We applied the same analyses as previously introduced for the study of responses to tones. We find effects of motion which are similar to those described in response to interaural phase modulation of tones. The size of the effects strongly depended on the motion parameters but was overall smaller than reported for tones. We found that the effects of motion could largely be explained by the temporal response pattern of the neuron such as adaptation and build-up. Our data add to previous evidence questioning true coding of motion at the level of the IC.\nPMID:\n38889563\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109066",

This study investigated the association of speed of information processing ability with spoken language outcomes after cochlear implantation in prelingually deaf children aged 4-6 years. Two domain-general (visual, non-linguistic) speed of information processing measures were administered to 21 preschool-aged children with cochlear implants and 23 normal-hearing peers. Measures of speech recognition, language (vocabulary and comprehension), nonverbal intelligence, and executive functioning skills were also obtained from each participant. Speed of information processing was positively associated with speech recognition and language skills in preschool-aged children with cochlear implants but not in normal-hearing peers. This association remained significant after controlling for hearing group, age, nonverbal intelligence, and executive functioning skills. These findings are consistent with models suggesting that domain-general, fast-efficient information processing speed underlies adaptation to speech perception and language learning following implantation. Assessment and intervention strategies targeting speed of information processing may provide better understanding and development of speech-language skills after cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38889562\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109069",

Using a cross-sectional design, 87 adults with T2DM and 48 non-diabetic controls, all with normal hearing, participated. The two central auditory processing (CAP) skills were assessed through the Gaps-In-Noise (GIN) and Dichotic-Digits Listening (DDL) tests. T2DM participants underwent blood tests to measure various health-related factors. In the GIN test, the shortest gap threshold (GapTh) obtained across both ears was significantly higher in the diabetic group (9.1 ± 2.4 ms) compared to the non-diabetic group (7.5 ± 1.5 ms), and the score of correctly identified gaps (GapSc) in the diabetic group (45±11 %) was significantly lower than GapSc in the non-diabetic group (52±9 %), p < 0.001. In the DDL test, the free-recall score (73.8 ± 18.5 %) across both ears and the right-ear advantage (-1.3 ± 20.6 %) in the diabetic group were significantly lower than the free-recall score (85.8 ± 11.9 %) and right-ear advantage (6.9 ± 11.9 %) in the non-diabetic group, p < 0.005. Furthermore, the duration of diabetes, eGFR level, retinopathy, carotid plaque, fasting blood glucose level, and HDL-C (good cholesterol) level were factors significantly associated with performances in the GIN and/or DDL tests for T2DM participants. In conclusion, individuals with T2DM are at risk of reduced auditory processing skills in temporal resolution and dichotic listening, impacting their speech understanding. Six health-related factors were identified as significantly associated with CAP skills in T2DM patients.\nPMID:\n38870778\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109067",

The present investigation delves into the contribution of the Mfsd2a molecule, integral to the structural and functional integrity of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), to the ontogeny and sustenance of the BLB. Our empirical findings delineate that the maturation of the BLB in murine models is not realized until approximately two weeks post-birth, with preceding stages characterized by notable permeability. Transcriptomic analysis elucidates a marked augmentation in Mfsd2a expression within the lateral wall of the cochlea in specimens exhibiting an intact BLB. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo assays substantiate that a diminution in Mfsd2a expression detrimentally impacts BLB permeability and structural integrity, principally via the attenuation of tight junction protein expression and the enhancement of endothelial cell transcytosis. These insights underscore the indispensable role of Mfsd2a in ensuring BLB integrity and propose it as a viable target for therapeutic interventions aimed at the amelioration of hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38852535\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109048",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nSince the presence of tinnitus is not always associated with audiometric hearing loss, it has been hypothesized that hidden hearing loss may act as a potential trigger for increased central gain along the neural pathway leading to tinnitus perception. In recent years, the study of hidden hearing loss has improved with the discovery of cochlear synaptopathy and several objective diagnostic markers. This study investigated three potential markers of peripheral hidden hearing loss in subjects with tinnitus: extended high-frequency audiometric thresholds, the auditory brainstem response, and the envelope following response. In addition, speech intelligibility was measured as a functional outcome measurement of hidden hearing loss. To account for age-related hidden hearing loss, participants were grouped according to age, presence of tinnitus, and audiometric thresholds. Group comparisons were conducted to differentiate between age- and tinnitus-related effects of hidden hearing loss. All three markers revealed age-related differences, whereas no differences were observed between the tinnitus and non-tinnitus groups. However, the older tinnitus group showed improved performance on low-pass filtered speech in noise tests compared to the older non-tinnitus group. These low-pass speech in noise scores were significantly correlated with tinnitus distress, as indicated using questionnaires, and could be related to the presence of hyperacusis. Based on our observations, cochlear synaptopathy does not appear to be the underlying cause of tinnitus. The improvement in low-pass speech-in-noise could be explained by enhanced temporal fine structure encoding or hyperacusis. Therefore, we recommend that future tinnitus research takes into account age-related factors, explores low-frequency encoding, and thoroughly assesses hyperacusis.\nPMID:\n38852534\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109050",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe round window (RW) membrane plays an important role in normal inner ear mechanics. Occlusion or reinforcement of the RW has been described in the context of congenital anomalies or after cochlear implantation and is applied as a surgical treatment for hyperacusis. Multiple lumped and finite element models predict a low-frequency hearing loss with air conduction of up to 20 dB after RW reinforcement and limited to no effect on hearing with bone conduction stimulation. Experimental verification of these results, however, remains limited. Here, we present an experimental study measuring the impact of RW reinforcement on the middle and inner ear mechanics with air and bone conduction stimulation. In a within-specimen repeated measures design with human cadaveric specimens (n = 6), we compared the intracochlear pressures in scala vestibuli (P\nSV\n) and scala tympani (P\nST\n) before and after RW reinforcement with soft tissue, cartilage, and bone cement. The differential pressure (P\nDIFF\n) across the basilar membrane - known to be closely related to the hearing sensation - was calculated as the complex difference between P\nSV\nand P\nST\n. With air conduction stimulation, both P\nSV\nand P\nST\nincreased on average up to 22 dB at frequencies below 1500 Hz with larger effect sizes for P\nST\ncompared to P\nSV\n. The P\nDIFF\n, in contrast, decreased up to 11 dB at frequencies between 700 and 800 Hz after reinforcement with bone cement. With bone conduction, the average within-specimen effects were less than 5 dB for either P\nSV\n, P\nST,\nor P\nDIFF\n. The inter-specimen variability with bone conduction, however, was considerably larger than with air conduction. This experimental study shows that RW reinforcement impacts air conduction stimulation at low frequencies. Bone conduction stimulation seems to be largely unaffected. From a clinical point of view, these results support the hypothesis that delayed loss of air conduction hearing after cochlear implantation could be partially explained by the impact of RW reinforcement.\nPMID:\n38850830\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109049",

In vitro, we introduced oxidative stress within HEI-OC1 cells by H\n2\nO\n2\nand exogenously changed the miR-130b-3p and PPARγ levels. MiRNA level was detected by RT-qPCR, proteins by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Morphology of autophagosomes was observed by electron microscopy. In vivo, the cochlea of aged mice showed higher miR-130b-3p expression and lower PPARγ expression, while exogenous inhibition of miR-130b-3p up-regulated PPARγ expression. Autophagy-related biomarkers expression (ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3B II/I) decreased in aged mice, which reversely increased after the inhibition of miR-130b-3p. The elevation of PPARγ demonstrated similar effects. Contrarily, exogenous overexpression of miR-130b-3p resulted in the decrease of ATG5, Beclin-1 and LC3B II/I.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of tinnitus, there are limited options for effective treatment. Tinnitus treatments are made more complicated by the lack of a test for tinnitus based on objectively measured physiological characteristics. Such an objective test would enable a greater understanding of tinnitus mechanisms and may lead to faster treatment development in both animal and human research. This review makes the argument that an objective tinnitus test, such as a non-invasive electrophysiological measure, is desperately needed. We review the current tinnitus assessment methods, the underlying neural correlates of tinnitus, the multiple tinnitus generation theories, and the previously investigated electrophysiological measurements of tinnitus. Finally, we propose an alternate objective test for tinnitus that may be valid in both animal and human subjects.\nPMID:\n38810373\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109046",

Epub 2024 May 25.\nABSTRACT\nAlthough rats and mice are among the preferred animal models for investigating many characteristics of auditory function, they are rarely used to study an essential aspect of binaural hearing: the ability of animals to localize the sources of low-frequency sounds by detecting the interaural time difference (ITD), that is the difference in the time at which the sound arrives at each ear. In mammals, ITDs are mostly encoded in the medial superior olive (MSO), one of the main nuclei of the superior olivary complex (SOC). Because of their small heads and high frequency hearing range, rats and mice are often considered unable to use ITDs for sound localization. Moreover, their MSO is frequently viewed as too small or insignificant compared to that of mammals that use ITDs to localize sounds, including cats and gerbils. However, recent research has demonstrated remarkable similarities between most morphological and physiological features of mouse MSO neurons and those of MSO neurons of mammals that use ITDs. In this context, we have analyzed the structure and neural afferent and efferent connections of the rat MSO, which had never been studied by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into the nucleus. The rat MSO spans the SOC longitudinally. It is relatively small caudally, but grows rostrally into a well-developed column of stacked bipolar neurons. By placing small, precise injections of the bidirectional tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the MSO, we show that this nucleus is innervated mainly by the most ventral and rostral spherical bushy cells of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus of both sides, and by the most ventrolateral principal neurons of the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. The same experiments reveal that the MSO densely innervates the most dorsolateral region of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, the central region of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and the most lateral region of the intermediate nucleus of the lateral lemniscus of its own side. Therefore, the MSO is selectively innervated by, and sends projections to, neurons that process low-frequency sounds. The structural and hodological features of the rat MSO are notably similar to those of the MSO of cats and gerbils. While these similarities raise the question of what functions other than ITD coding the MSO performs, they also suggest that the rat MSO is an appropriate model for future MSO-centered research.\nPMID:\n38797037\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109036",

Impairment of inner ear functions is the main cause of hearing loss. In aged individuals, not only inner ear dysfunction but also senescence of the central nervous system is the cause of malfunction of the auditory system. In most cases of hearing loss, the activity of the auditory nerve is reduced, but that of the successive auditory centers is increased in a compensatory way. It has been reported that activity changes occur in the inferior colliculus (IC), a critical nexus of the auditory pathway. The IC integrates the inputs from the brainstem and drives the higher auditory centers. Since abnormal activity in the IC is likely to affect auditory perception, it is crucial to elucidate the neuronal mechanism to induce the activity changes of IC neurons with hearing loss. This review outlines recent findings on hearing-loss-induced plastic changes in the IC and brainstem auditory neuronal circuits and discusses what neuronal mechanisms underlie hearing-loss-induced changes in the activity of IC neurons. Considering the different causes of hearing loss, we discuss age-related hearing loss separately from other forms of hearing loss (non-age-related hearing loss). In general, the main plastic change of IC neurons caused by both age-related and non-age-related hearing loss is increased central gain. However, plastic changes in the IC caused by age-related hearing loss seem to be more complex than those caused by non-age-related hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38797036\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109033",

Epub 2024 May 17.\nABSTRACT\nNeurons within a neuronal network can be grouped by bottom-up and top-down influences using synchrony in neuronal oscillations. This creates the representation of perceptual objects from sensory features. Oscillatory activity can be differentiated into stimulus-phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced). The former is mainly determined by sensory input, the latter by higher-level (cortical) processing. Effects of auditory deprivation on cortical oscillations have been studied in congenitally deaf cats (CDCs) using cochlear implant (CI) stimulation. CI-induced alpha, beta, and gamma activity were compromised in the auditory cortex of CDCs. Furthermore, top-down information flow between secondary and primary auditory areas in hearing cats, conveyed by induced alpha oscillations, was lost in CDCs. Here we used the matching pursuit algorithm to assess components of such oscillatory activity in local field potentials recorded in primary field A1. Additionally to the loss of induced alpha oscillations, we also found a loss of evoked theta activity in CDCs. The loss of theta and alpha activity in CDCs can be directly related to reduced high-frequency (gamma-band) activity due to cross-frequency coupling. Here we quantified such cross-frequency coupling in adult 1) hearing-experienced, acoustically stimulated cats (aHCs), 2) hearing-experienced cats following acute pharmacological deafening and subsequent CIs, thus in electrically stimulated cats (eHCs), and 3) electrically stimulated CDCs. We found significant cross-frequency coupling in all animal groups in > 70% of auditory-responsive sites. The predominant coupling in aHCs and eHCs was between theta/alpha phase and gamma power. In CDCs such coupling was lost and replaced by alpha oscillations coupling to delta/theta phase. Thus, alpha/theta oscillations synchronize high-frequency gamma activity only in hearing-experienced cats. The absence of induced alpha and theta oscillations contributes to the loss of induced gamma power in CDCs, thereby signifying impaired local network activity.\nPMID:\n38797035\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109032",

Here, we investigated aging effects on perception and neural representation of the consonant transition and the factors that contribute to successful perception. To further understand the neural mechanisms underlying the changes in processing from brainstem to cortex, we also examined the factors that contribute to exaggerated amplitudes in cortex. We enrolled 30 younger normal-hearing and 30 older normal-hearing participants who met the criteria of clinically normal hearing. Perceptual identification functions were obtained for the words BEAT and WHEAT on a 7-step continuum of consonant-transition duration. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded to click stimuli and frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical auditory-evoked potentials were recorded to the endpoints of the BEAT-WHEAT continuum. Perceptual performance for identification of BEAT vs. WHEAT did not differ between younger and older listeners. However, both subcortical and cortical measures of neural representation showed age group differences, such that FFR phase locking was lower but cortical amplitudes (P1 and N1) were higher in older compared to younger listeners. ABR Wave I amplitude and FFR phase locking, but not audiometric thresholds, predicted early cortical amplitudes. Phase locking to the transition region and early cortical peak amplitudes (P1) predicted performance on the perceptual identification function. Overall, results suggest that the neural representation of transition durations and cortical overcompensation may contribute to the ability to perceive transition duration contrasts. Cortical overcompensation appears to be a maladaptive response to decreased neural firing/synchrony.\nPMID:\n38781768\n| PMC:\nPMC11156531\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109034",

Outcomes are impressive and most recipients attain excellent speech comprehension in quiet without relying on lip-reading cues, but pitch resolution is poor compared to normal hearing. Amplitude modulation of electrical stimulation is a primary cue for pitch perception in cochlear implant users. The experiments described in this article focus on the relationship between sensitivity to amplitude modulations and pitch resolution based on changes in the frequency of amplitude modulations. In the first experiment, modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution were measured in adults with no known hearing loss and in cochlear implant users with sounds presented to and processed by their clinical devices. Stimuli were amplitude-modulated sinusoids and amplitude-modulated narrow-band noises. Modulation detection and modulation frequency discrimination were measured for modulation frequencies centered on 110, 220, and 440 Hz. Pitch resolution based on changes in modulation frequency was measured for modulation depths of 25 %, 50 %, 100 %, and for a half-waved rectified modulator. Results revealed a strong linear relationship between modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution for cochlear implant users and peers with no known hearing loss. In the second experiment, cochlear implant users took part in analogous procedures of modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution but bypassing clinical sound processing using single-electrode stimulation. Results indicated that modulation sensitivity and pitch resolution was better conveyed by single-electrode stimulation than by clinical processors. Results at 440 Hz were worse, but also not well conveyed by clinical sound processing, so it remains unclear whether the 300 Hz perceptual limit described in the literature is a technological or biological limitation. These results highlight modulation depth and sensitivity as critical factors for pitch resolution in cochlear implant users and characterize the relationship that should inform the design of modulation enhancement algorithms for cochlear implants.\nPMID:\n38776706\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109026",

Epub 2024 May 14.\nABSTRACT\nSex is a pivotal biological factor that significantly impacts tissue homeostasis and disease susceptibility. In the auditory system, sex differences have been observed in cochlear physiology and responses to pathological conditions. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences remain elusive. The current research explores the differences in gene expression profiles in the cochlea between male and female mice, aiming to understand the functional implication of sex-biased gene expression in each sex. Using RNA-sequencing analysis on cochlear tissues obtained from male and female mice, we identified a significant number of genes exhibiting sex-biased expression differences. While some of these differentially expressed genes are located on sex chromosomes, most are found on autosomal chromosomes. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that these genes are involved in several key cellular functions. In males, these genes are notably linked to oxidative phosphorylation and RNA synthesis and processing, suggesting their involvement in mitochondrial energy production and regulatory control of gene expression. In contrast, sex-biased genes are associated with mechano-transduction and synaptic transmission within female cochleae. Collectively, our study provides valuable insights into the molecular differences between the sexes and emphasizes the need for future research to uncover their functional implications and relevance to auditory health and disease development.\nPMID:\n38776705\n| DOI:\n10.1016/j.heares.2024.109030",

In this study we tested whether AGC synchronisation in a dual-loop front-end processing scheme with a 3:1 compression ratio improves sound localisation acuity.\nDESIGN: Source identification in the frontal hemifield was tested in in an anechoic chamber as a function of (roving) presentation level. Three different methods of AGC synchronisation were compared to the standard unsynchronised approach.

For synchronised AGC, the pooled mean (standard deviation) localisation error of the three synchronisation methods was 24.7 (5.8) degrees RMSE, for unsynchronised AGC it was 27.4 (7.5) degrees. The localisation bias was 5.1 (5.5) degrees for synchronised AGC and 5.0 (3.8) for unsynchronised.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support the hypothesis that the tested AGC synchronisation configurations improves localisation acuity in bilateral users of MED-EL cochlear implants.\nPMID:\n39075948\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2383700",

Here, we aimed to assess potential neural changes following TRT using mismatch negativity (MMN).\nDESIGN: Chronic tinnitus (>6 months) patients participated in a six-month TRT program. We collected tinnitus psychoacoustic features and gathered the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) before and after TRT. We also used a multi-featured paradigm, including frequency, intensity, duration, location and silent gap deviants, to elicit MMN response before and after TRT. Data were analyzed retrospectively.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: The study involved 26 chronic tinnitus patients.\nRESULTS: Post-TRT measurements showed that MMN amplitudes significantly increased for all deviant conditions (p ≤ .03). However, we did not find a significant difference in MMN latencies for all deviant conditions (p ≥ .13). The THI scores of the patients significantly decreased following the TRT program (\np\n< 0.001). Our results reveal improved subjective tinnitus perception following the TRT program.\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that TRT might be a viable alternative in tinnitus management. The greater MMN amplitudes and improved subjective tinnitus perception raise the possibility that MMN can be a useful tool in tinnitus research and tinnitus patient follow-up.\nPMID:\n39037049\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2378800",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVE: To assess transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) data from 15 years of a newborn hearing screening program and evaluate how well various criteria separate ears with and without hearing loss.\nDESIGN: Retrospective review of TEOAE data using logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curves, and cumulative percentage graphs.Study sample: Children with hearing loss who passed TEOAE screening as a newborn were compared to children who failed TEOAE screening and normal hearing children who either passed or failed. Exclusions were applied for acquired hearing loss or auditory neuropathy.\nRESULTS: Ears with hearing loss that passed screening had significantly lower TEOAE response levels compared to ears with normal hearing. Noise levels, test times, and number of sweeps were also lower. Most of these ears had mild hearing loss. Logistic regression results showed that high-frequency TEOAE response level is the best predictor of hearing loss. A multivariate \"logit\" score calculated from the regression was the best indicator for separating ears with hearing loss from ears with normal hearing.\nCONCLUSIONS: TEOAE response levels or an algorithm which incorporates logit scores should be considered as a minimum passing criterion to increase the sensitivity of the TEOAE screening.\nPMID:\n39033358\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2378808",

They were fitted with hearing aids and followed for six months after fitting. The PF group was asked to report positive listening experiences in their daily life via an app. Participants in both groups were periodically prompted by the app to answer questionnaires about hearing aid satisfaction and benefit. Two follow-up visits at approximately one and six months were performed.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 20 adult first-time hearing aid users in the control and 18 in the PF group.\nRESULTS: Hearing aid satisfaction and benefit scores were significantly better in the PF group, already at two weeks and throughout the six months. In the PF group, the hearing aid outcomes were positively correlated with the number of submitted positive reports.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results point to the importance of asking first-time hearing aid users to focus on positive listening experiences and to reflect upon them.

Only 1.38% reported tinnitus as a big problem or worse. Univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between tinnitus constancy and duration with severity, where more constant perception and longer duration was related to increased severity (\np\n< 0.0001). Multivariable models showed a clear relationship of increased odds ratio (OR) of problematic tinnitus with constancy of tinnitus but not duration. Furthermore, multivariable models showed higher Body Mass Index (OR= 1.013, 95% CI: 0.99-1.03), sleep trouble (OR = 2.016, 95% CI: 1.52-2.66) and comorbidities (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.06-1.94) were all associated with increased problematic tinnitus, but not non-problematic tinnitus.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the prevalence of problematic tinnitus is much lower than the prevalence of any tinnitus.

Analysis of 2122 meaning units from responses identified two broad domains: 'meaningful benefits' (n = 1709; 80.5%) and 'remaining difficulties' (n = 413; 19.5%). The meaningful benefits domain included five categories (27 sub-categories): (a) psychosocial benefits, (b) improvements in hearing, (c) personal benefits, (d) hearing aid features and connectivity, and (e) situational benefits. Participants reported enhanced relationships and improved occupational functioning as key benefits. The remaining difficulties domain contained four categories (25 sub-categories): (a) hearing aid limitations, (b) hearing and communication issues, (c) situational difficulties, and (d) personal issues. Notable difficulties included hearing aid design issues and challenges in noisy environments.\nCONCLUSION: Hearing aid users reported diverse benefits and persistent challenges related to device use, illustrating the complexity of their lived experiences.

The subject presented with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and diplacusis a day after onset. Testing involved detailed interview, standard audiometry, detailed inter-octave audiometry, and measurement of detailed psychophysical frequency tuning curves during a two day recovery period.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: One male aged in his thirties with otherwise normal hearing.\nRESULTS: Although standard audiometry was within normal limits, detailed inter-octave audiometry and psychophysical frequency tuning curves were consistent with a punctate unilateral intra-cochlear lesion that resolved over a period of three days.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of such a frequency-specific audiometric shift and diplacusis after sildenafil, and is not consistent with previous reports of direct ototoxic pharmacological effects. We propose that the lesion was most likely caused by a cochlear bleed, and may have been due to physical exertion rather than a direct pharmaceutical effect.

Existing interventions lack effectiveness and are typically not based on a theoretically driven, comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing infant hearing aid use. The present study is the first to address this gap in understanding.\nDESIGN AND STUDY SAMPLE: A 55-item online survey based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was completed by 56 parents of 0-3-year-old hearing aid users.\nRESULTS: Participants reported a wide range of barriers across TDF domains, which were associated with parent-reported hearing aid use and more pronounced in parents of lower hearing aid users. The most strongly reported domains across participants were \"emotion\" (e.g. feelings of worry when using hearing aids), \"beliefs about capabilities\" (e.g. belief in ability to use hearing aids consistently), and \"environmental context and resources\" (e.g. child removing hearing aids).\nCONCLUSIONS: Parents report a wider range of barriers to infant hearing aid use than existing investigations suggest and current interventions address. Interventions would benefit from: (i) targeting a wider range of TDF domains in their design; and (ii) implementing the present TDF survey to identify and target family-specific barriers to infant hearing aid use.\nPMID:\n38913029\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2358428",

The average DR across frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) was correlated with the patients' assigned word recognition score (WRS) in quiet.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: A data set of 66 cases (4 bilateral and 2 revised cases) from 60 implanted patients between 14.3-81.8 years were analysed.\nRESULTS: The relationship between DR and WRS was described by a sigmoidal growth function with R\n2\n=0.6371 and a maximum WRS (upper asymptote) of 93.5%. Word recognition scores in quiet improved with increasing DR. A significant shift in performance was detected from DR bin 2 (10-20 dB, median WRS 55%) to bin 3 (20-30 dB, median WRS 80%) and from DR bin 4 (30-40 dB, median WRS 82.5%) to bin 5 (40-50 dB, median WRS 90%).\nCONCLUSION: A minimum DR of 20 dB can yield sufficient speech intelligibility in quiet in implanted patients, however, an optimum DR is suggested to be 40 dB.\nPMID:\n38832702\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2360031",

Two themes were identified, specifically: (1) an association between HL and hearing aids and the stereotypes of ageing, disability, and difference; and (2) varied views on the existence and experience of stigma for adults with HL. Hearing care professionals focused on the stigma of hearing aids more than HL, whereas adult participants focused on stigma of HL. Family member data indicated that they experienced little affiliate stigma.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stigma-induced identity threat related to HL and, to a lesser extent, hearing aids exists for adults with HL.

Relations between attenuation measured on participants (for 6 different earplugs) and their earcanal size assessed with the EE are established via comparison tests.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 121 participants exposed to occupational noise (103 men, 18 women, mean age 47 year\ns\n).\nRESULTS: The earcanal size assessed with the EE allows for estimating the area of the earcanal's first bend cross-section (correlation coefficient  r = 0.533,\np\n< 0.001). Extremely large earcanals (12.7% of earcanals in our sample) lead to significantly lower earplug attenuation (potentially inadequate) than smaller earcanals.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EE is a simple and inexpensive tool easily deployable in the field to assist earplugs selection.

To also investigate the effects of three otologic history factors.\nDESIGN: Using headphone presentation, speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were measured with simple sentences. As maskers, stationary speech-shaped noise (SSN) or two-talker running speech (TTS) were used. The stimuli were presented in a monaural and binaural condition (SSN) or a co-located and spatially separated condition (TTS). Based on the available medical records, overall OM duration, OM onset age, and time since the last OM episode were estimated.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: 6-13-year-olds with a history of recurrent OM (\nN\n= 42) or without any ear diseases (\nN\n= 20) with normal tympanograms and audiograms at the time of testing.\nRESULTS: Mixed-model regression analyses that controlled for age showed poorer SRTs for the OM group (Δ-value = 0.84 dB,\np\n= 0.009). These appeared driven by the spatially separated, binaural, and monaural conditions. The OM group showed large inter-individual differences, which were unrelated to the otologic history factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early-childhood OM can affect speech recognition in different acoustic conditions.

Participants with hearing loss underwent testing in two device conditions: hearing aids (HAs) alone and HAs with a RM. Normal hearing participants completed testing in the unaided condition. Predictive speech intelligibility modelling using the Hearing-Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI) was also performed on recordings of HA processed test material.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Twenty adults with sensory hearing loss and 10 adults with normal hearing participated.\nRESULTS: Speech recognition for participants with hearing loss improved significantly when using the RM compared to HAs alone fit to Phonak's proprietary prescription. Largest benefits were observed in the most challenging conditions. At the lowest signal-to-noise ratio, participants with hearing loss using a RM outperformed normal hearing listeners. Predicted intelligibility scores produced by HASPI were strongly correlated to behavioural results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adults using HAs who have significant difficulties understanding speech in noise will experience considerable benefits with the addition of a RM. Improvements in speech recognition were observed for all participants using RM systems, including those with relatively mild hearing loss.

Differences in reference equivalent threshold vibratory force levels were estimated by comparing hearing threshold measurements of 60 healthy ears using B81 and B250.\nRESULTS: B250 has approximately 27 dB higher sensitivity levels than both B71 and B81 at 250 Hz and can generate higher maximum hearing level at low frequencies: 11.8 to 35.8 dB (125-1000 Hz) higher than B71, and 1.4 to 18.6 dB (125-750 Hz) higher than B81.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Some adults experience challenges in successfully communicating their listening difficulties to their audiologist, and report feeling that they are not always listened to or understood. This project examined adults' recollections of discussions with their audiologist to explore (1) how adults report describing their listening difficulties and (2) information that adults report they do not communicate, or do not communicate successfully, to their audiologist.\nDESIGN: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interview transcripts were analysed using a template analysis approach.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen adults who self-report listening difficulties, and who had previously consulted an audiologist.\nRESULTS: Four themes were identified from adults' recollections of how they describe their listening difficulties: (1) situation or context of listening difficulties, (2) behavioural responses, (3) impacts of listening difficulties and (4) contributing factors. Adults report not always successfully communicating (1) emotional concerns and impacts, (2) descriptions of sound quality and (3) descriptions of changed listening experiences.\nCONCLUSION: Results provide insights about the times when adults feel that communication with their audiologist is successful, or unsuccessful. The results are useful for informing interventions to help adults and audiologists communicate more effectively together. To further inform interventions, factors affecting adults' communication should be explored.\nPMID:\n38739207\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2351033",

Late peaks were present bilaterally in 78%. The p13-n23 response was present in all patients with SNHL but normal vestibular function, and 43% had late waves. Statistical comparison of these patients to a subset of age-matched controls showed no significant difference in the frequencies, amplitudes or latencies of their ipsilateral early and late peaks. cVEMPs were absent in all patients with vestibular impairment.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of long-latency cVEMP waves was not dependent on the integrity of sensorineural hearing pathways, but instead correlated with intact vestibular function. This finding conflicts with the view that these late waves are cochlear in origin, and suggests that vestibular afferents may assume a more prominent role in their generation.\nPMID:\n38739080\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2341101",

Standard hearing aids differ from a CI in terms of processing strategy and function as a separate entity, requiring the user to integrate the disparate signals. Integrated bimodal technology has recently been introduced to address this challenge. The aim of the study was to investigate the performance of unilateral CI users with and without an integrated bimodal fitting and determine whether binaural streaming technology offers additional benefit.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-six CI users using integrated bimodal technology.\nDESIGN: Repeated measures where outcomes and user experience were assessed using a functional test battery more representative of real life listening (speech perception in noise tests, localisation test, tracking test) and the speech, spatial and qualities-of-hearing scale (SSQ).\nRESULTS: Bimodal outcomes were significantly better than for CI alone. Speech perception in noise improvements ranged from 1.4 dB to 3.5 dB depending on the location of speech and noise. The localisation and tracking tests, and the SSQ also showed significant improvements. Binaural streaming offered additional improvement (1.2 dB to 6.1 dB on the different speech tests).\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrated bimodal and binaural streaming technology improved the performance of unilateral CI users.\nPMID:\n38701176\n| DOI:\n10.1080/14992027.2024.2341954",

Reports of hearing-impaired people indicate that strenuous listening situations occurring throughout the day lead to feelings of fatigue at the end of the day. The aim of the present study was to develop a suitable test sequence to evoke and measure listening effort (LE) and listening-related fatigue (LRF), and, to evaluate the influence of hearing aid use on both dimensions in mild to moderately hearing-impaired participants. The chosen approach aims to reconstruct a representative acoustic day (Time Compressed Acoustic Day [TCAD]) by means of an eight-part hearing-test sequence with a total duration of approximately 2½ h. For this purpose, the hearing test sequence combined four different listening tasks with five different acoustic scenarios and was presented to the 20 test subjects using virtual acoustics in an open field measurement in aided and unaided conditions. Besides subjective ratings of LE and LRF, behavioral measures (response accuracy, reaction times), and an attention test (d2-R) were performed prior to and after the TCAD. Furthermore, stress hormones were evaluated by taking salivary samples. Subjective ratings of LRF increased throughout the test sequence. This effect was observed to be higher when testing unaided. In three of the eight listening tests, the aided condition led to significantly faster reaction times/response accuracies than in the unaided condition. In the d2-R test, an interaction in processing speed between time (pre- vs. post-TCAD) and provision (unaided vs. aided) was found suggesting an influence of hearing aid provision on LRF. A comparison of the averaged subjective ratings at the beginning and end of the TCAD shows a significant increase in LRF for both conditions. At the end of the TCAD, subjective fatigue was significantly lower when wearing hearing aids. The analysis of stress hormones did not reveal significant effects.\nPMID:\n39095047\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241265199",

For instance, at receptions people often stand while engaging in conversation. It is known that listening and postural control are associated with each other. Previous studies focused on the interplay of listening and postural control when the speech identification task had rather high cognitive control demands. This study aimed to determine whether listening and postural control interact when the speech identification task requires minimal cognitive control, i.e., when words are presented without background noise, or a large memory load. This study included 22 young adults, 27 middle-aged adults, and 21 older adults. Participants performed a speech identification task (auditory single task), a postural control task (posture single task) and combined postural control and speech identification tasks (dual task) to assess the effects of multitasking. The difficulty levels of the listening and postural control tasks were manipulated by altering the level of the words (25 or 30 dB SPL) and the mobility of the platform (stable or moving). The sound level was increased for adults with a hearing impairment. In the dual-task, listening performance decreased, especially for middle-aged and older adults, while postural control improved. These results suggest that even when cognitive control demands for listening are minimal, interaction with postural control occurs. Correlational analysis revealed that hearing loss was a better predictor than age of speech identification and postural control.\nPMID:\n39053897\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260621",

We observed a positive peak followed by a wide negative trough, with the latter being most evident in early epochs. We argue that the overall response morphology captures the effects of two simultaneous, but independent, response mechanisms that are both activated at the stimulus onset: one being the obligatory response to a sound stimulus by the auditory system, and the other being a neural suppression effect induced by the arousal system. Because the two effects behave differently with repeated epochs, it is possible to mathematically separate them and use fNIRS to study factors that affect the development and activation of the arousal system in infants. The results also imply that standard fNIRS analysis techniques need to be adjusted to take into account the possibilities of multiple simultaneous brain systems being activated and that the response to a stimulus is not necessarily stationary.\nPMID:\n39053892\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241258056",

The purpose of this study was the development of a novel speech-recognition test that combines concepts of different speech-recognition tests to reduce training effects and allows for a large set of speech material. The new test consists of four different words per trial in a meaningful construct with a fixed structure, the so-called phrases. Various free databases were used to select the words and to determine their frequency. Highly frequent nouns were grouped into thematic categories and combined with related adjectives and infinitives. After discarding inappropriate and unnatural combinations, and eliminating duplications of (sub-)phrases, a total number of 772 phrases remained. Subsequently, the phrases were synthesized using a text-to-speech system. The synthesis significantly reduces the effort compared to recordings with a real speaker. After excluding outliers, measured speech-recognition scores for the phrases with 31 normal-hearing participants at fixed signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) revealed speech-recognition thresholds (SRT) for each phrase varying up to 4 dB. The median SRT was -9.1 dB SNR and thus comparable to existing sentence tests. The psychometric function's slope of 15 percentage points per dB is also comparable and enables efficient use in audiology.

These individual differences have been reported to be associated with a range of auditory and cognitive abilities. The present study addresses the association between SiN processing and the individual susceptibility of short-term memory to auditory distraction (i.e., the irrelevant sound effect [ISE]). In a sample of 67 young adult participants with normal audiometric thresholds, we measured speech recognition performance in a spatial listening task with two interfering talkers (speech-in-speech identification), audiometric thresholds, binaural sensitivity to the temporal fine structure (interaural phase differences [IPD]), serial memory with and without interfering talkers, and self-reported noise sensitivity. Speech-in-speech processing was not significantly associated with the ISE. The most important predictors of high speech-in-speech recognition performance were a large short-term memory span, low IPD thresholds, bilaterally symmetrical audiometric thresholds, and low individual noise sensitivity. Surprisingly, the susceptibility of short-term memory to irrelevant sound accounted for a substantially smaller amount of variance in speech-in-speech processing than the nondisrupted short-term memory capacity. The data confirm the role of binaural sensitivity to the temporal fine structure, although its association to SiN recognition was weaker than in some previous studies. The inverse association between self-reported noise sensitivity and SiN processing deserves further investigation.\nPMID:\n39051688\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241262517",

The intended impact was to support practice regarding candidacy assessment and prognostic counseling of pediatric cochlear implant candidates. Data in the clinical chart of children implanted at 9-11 months of age with Cochlear Ltd devices at five cochlear implant centers in the United States and Canada were included in analyses. The study included data from two cohorts implanted with one or two Nucleus devices during the periods of January 1, 2012-December 31, 2017 (Cohort 1, n = 83) or between January 1, 2018 and May 15, 2020 (Cohort 2, n = 50). Major adverse events (requiring another procedure/hospitalization) and minor adverse events (managed with medication alone or underwent an expected course of treatment that did not require surgery or hospitalization) out to 2 years post-implant were monitored and outcomes measured by audiometric thresholds and parent-reports on the IT-MAIS and LittlEARS questionnaires were collected. Results revealed 60 adverse events in 41 children and 227 ears implanted (26%) of which 14 major events occurred in 11 children; all were transitory and resolved. Improved hearing with cochlear implant use was shown in all outcome measures. Findings reveal that the procedure is safe for infants and that they show clear benefits of cochlear implantation including increased audibility and hearing development.\nPMID:\n38887094\n| PMC:\nPMC11185016\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241261480",

For almost as many years, clinicians and researchers have sought ways to distill the volume and complexity of information on the audiogram. Commonly used approaches have made use of pure-tone averages (PTAs) for various frequency ranges with the PTA for 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz (PTA4) being the most widely used for the categorization of hearing loss severity. Here, a three-digit triad is proposed as a single-number summary of not only the severity, but also the configuration and bilateral symmetry of the hearing loss. Each digit in the triad ranges from 0 to 9, increasing as the level of the pure-tone hearing threshold level (HTL) increases from a range of optimal hearing (< 10 dB Hearing Level; HL) to complete hearing loss (≥ 90 dB HL). Each digit also represents a different frequency region of the audiogram proceeding from left to right as: (Low, L) PTA for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz; (Center, C) PTA for 3000, 4000 and 6000 Hz; and (High, H) HTL at 8000 Hz. This LCH Triad audiogram-classification system is evaluated using a large United States (U.S.) national dataset (N = 8,795) from adults 20 to 80 + years of age and two large clinical datasets totaling 8,254 adults covering a similar age range. Its ability to capture variations in hearing function was found to be superior to that of the widely used PTA4.\nPMID:\n38870447\n| PMC:\nPMC11179497\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260041",

However, its validity has been a subject of debate, as previous studies noted differences between hearing thresholds measured using conventional and in-situ audiometry. The differences were particularly notable for open-fit hearing aids, attributed to low-frequency leakage caused by the vent. Here, in-situ audiometry was investigated for six receiver-in-canal hearing aids from different manufacturers through three experiments. In Experiment I, the hearing aid gain was measured to investigate whether corrections were implemented to the prescribed target gain. In Experiment II, the in-situ stimuli were recorded to investigate if corrections were directly incorporated to the delivered in-situ stimulus. Finally, in Experiment III, hearing thresholds using in-situ and conventional audiometry were measured with real patients wearing open-fit hearing aids. Results indicated that (1) the hearing aid gain remained unaffected when measured with in-situ or conventional audiometry for all open-fit measurements, (2) the in-situ stimuli were adjusted for up to 30 dB at frequencies below 1000 Hz for all open-fit hearing aids except one, which also recommends the use of closed domes for all in-situ measurements, and (3) the mean interparticipant threshold difference fell within 5 dB for frequencies between 250 and 6000 Hz. The results clearly indicated that modern measured in-situ thresholds align (within 5 dB) with conventional thresholds measured, indicating the potential of in-situ audiometry for remote hearing care.\nPMID:\n38835268\n| PMC:\nPMC11155351\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241259704",

One possible source of benefit is ANC's ability to reduce the sound level of the direct (i.e., vent-transmitted) path. This reduction lowers the \"floor\" imposed by the direct path, thereby allowing any increases to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) created in the amplified path to be \"realized\" at the eardrum. Here we used a modeling approach to estimate this benefit. We compared pairs of simulated hearing aids that differ only in terms of their ability to provide ANC and computed intelligibility metrics on their outputs. The difference in metric scores between simulated devices is termed the \"ANC Benefit.\" These simulations show that ANC Benefit increases as (1) the environmental sound level increases, (2) the ability of the hearing aid to improve SNR increases, (3) the strength of the ANC increases, and (4) the hearing loss severity decreases. The predicted size of the ANC Benefit can be substantial. For a moderate hearing loss, the model predicts improvement in intelligibility metrics of >30% when environments are moderately loud (>70 dB SPL) and devices are moderately capable of increasing SNR (by >4 dB). It appears that ANC can be a critical ingredient in hearing devices that attempt to improve SNR in loud environments. ANC will become more and more important as advanced SNR-improving algorithms (e.g., artificial intelligence speech enhancement) are included in hearing devices.\nPMID:\n38831646\n| PMC:\nPMC11149449\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241260029",

The data were retrieved from a total of 52 children with MBHL and 30 children with normal hearing (NH). The association between demographical, audiological factors and language outcomes was examined. Analyses of variance were conducted to compare the language abilities of HA users, non-HA users, and their NH peers. Furthermore, regression analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of language outcomes. Aided better ear pure-tone average (BEPTA) was significantly correlated with language comprehension scores. Among children with MBHL, those who used HA outperformed the ones who did not use HA across all linguistic domains. The language skills of children with MBHL were comparable to those of their peers with NH. The degree of improvement in audibility in terms of aided BEPTA was a significant predictor of language comprehension. It is noteworthy that 50% of the parents expressed reluctance regarding HA use for their children with MBHL. The findings highlight the positive impact of HA usage on language development in this population. Professionals may therefore consider HAs as a viable treatment option for children with MBHL, especially when there is a potential risk of language delay due to hearing loss. It was observed that 25% of the children with MBHL had late-onset hearing loss. Consequently, the implementation of preschool screening or a listening performance checklist is recommended to facilitate early detection.\nPMID:\n38773778\n| PMC:\nPMC11113073\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241256721",

Progressing beyond these unnatural stimuli, brainstem responses to continuous speech presented via earphones have been recently detected using linear temporal response functions (TRFs). Here, we extend earlier studies by measuring subcortical responses to continuous speech presented in the sound-field, and assess the amount of data needed to estimate brainstem TRFs. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 24 normal hearing participants while they listened to clicks and stories presented via earphones and loudspeakers. Subcortical TRFs were computed after accounting for non-linear processing in the auditory periphery by either stimulus rectification or an auditory nerve model. Our results demonstrated that subcortical responses to continuous speech could be reliably measured in the sound-field. TRFs estimated using auditory nerve models outperformed simple rectification, and 16 minutes of data was sufficient for the TRFs of all participants to show clear wave V peaks for both earphones and sound-field stimuli. Subcortical TRFs to continuous speech were highly consistent in both earphone and sound-field conditions, and with click ABRs. However, sound-field TRFs required slightly more data (16 minutes) to achieve clear wave V peaks compared to earphone TRFs (12 minutes), possibly due to effects of room acoustics. By investigating subcortical responses to sound-field speech stimuli, this study lays the groundwork for bringing objective hearing assessment closer to real-life conditions, which may lead to improved hearing evaluations and smart hearing technologies.\nPMID:\n38738341\n| PMC:\nPMC11092544\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246596",

Both age and noise exposure contribute to synaptopathy in animal models, indicating that it may be a common type of auditory dysfunction in humans. Temporal bone and auditory physiological data suggest that age and occupational/military noise exposure also lead to synaptopathy in humans. The predicted perceptual consequences of synaptopathy include tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. However, confirming the perceptual impacts of this form of cochlear deafferentation presents a particular challenge because synaptopathy can only be confirmed through post-mortem temporal bone analysis and auditory perception is difficult to evaluate in animals. Animal data suggest that deafferentation leads to increased central gain, signs of tinnitus and abnormal loudness perception, and deficits in temporal processing and signal-in-noise detection. If equivalent changes occur in humans following deafferentation, this would be expected to increase the likelihood of developing tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception. Physiological data from humans is consistent with the hypothesis that deafferentation is associated with increased central gain and a greater likelihood of tinnitus perception, while human data on the relationship between deafferentation and hyperacusis is extremely limited. Many human studies have investigated the relationship between physiological correlates of deafferentation and difficulty with speech-in-noise perception, with mixed findings. A non-linear relationship between deafferentation and speech perception may have contributed to the mixed results. When differences in sample characteristics and study measurements are considered, the findings may be more consistent.\nPMID:\n38738337\n| PMC:\nPMC11092548\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241239541",

A total of 4,589 SM undergoing annual audiometric surveillance were prospectively recruited to complete the THS tinnitus subscale (THS-T). A subset of 1,304 participants also completed the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). The original 5-point response scale of the THS (THS-T\n16\n) was modified to an 11-point scale (THS-T\n40\n) for some participants, to align with the response scale of the TFI. Age, sex, hearing loss, and self-reported tinnitus bother were also recorded. The THS-T was relatively insensitive to hearing, but self-reported bothersome tinnitus was significantly associated with the THS-T\n40\nscore. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine cutoff scores on the THS-T that aligned with recommended cutoff values for clinical intervention on the TFI. A cutoff of 9 on the THS-T\n40\naligns with a TFI cutoff of 25, indicating a patient may need intervention for tinnitus. A cutoff of 15 aligns with a TFI cutoff of 50, indicating that more aggressive intervention for tinnitus is warranted. The THS-T is a viable tool to identify patients with tinnitus complaints warranting clinical evaluation for use by hearing conservation programs and primary care clinics. The THS-T\n40\ncutoff scores of 9 and 15 provide clinical reference points to guide referrals to audiology.\nPMID:\n38738302\n| PMC:\nPMC11092559\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241242235",

A promising method is electrocochleography (ECochG). Within this project the relations between intracochlear ECochG recordings, position of the recording contact in the cochlea with respect to anatomy and frequency and preservation of residual hearing were investigated. The aim was to better understand the changes in ECochG signals and whether these are due to the electrode position in the cochlea or to trauma generated during insertion. During and after insertion of hearing preservation electrodes, intraoperative ECochG recordings were performed using the CI electrode (MED-EL). During insertion, the recordings were performed at discrete insertion steps on electrode contact 1. After insertion as well as postoperatively the recordings were performed at different electrode contacts. The electrode location in the cochlea during insertion was estimated by mathematical models using preoperative clinical imaging, the postoperative location was measured using postoperative clinical imaging. The recordings were analyzed from six adult CI recipients. In the four patients with good residual hearing in the low frequencies the signal amplitude rose with largest amplitudes being recorded closest to the generators of the stimulation frequency, while in both cases with severe pantonal hearing losses the amplitude initially rose and then dropped. This might be due to various reasons as discussed in the following. Our results indicate that this approach can provide valuable information for the interpretation of intracochlearly recorded ECochG signals.\nPMID:\n38717441\n| PMC:\nPMC11080744\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241248973",

A link with the degree of postoperative hearing preservation in patients was investigated, but patient populations were usually small. Therefore, this study's aim was to analyze data from intraoperative extracochlear electrocochleography (ECochG) recordings for a larger group.During hearing preservation CI surgery, extracochlear recordings were made before, during, and after CI electrode insertion using a cotton wick electrode placed at the promontory. Before and after insertion, amplitudes and stimulus response thresholds were recorded at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz. During insertion, response amplitudes were recorded at one frequency and one stimulus level. Data from 121 patient ears were analyzed.The key benefit of extracochlear recordings is that they can be performed before, during, and after CI electrode insertion. However, extracochlear ECochG threshold changes before and after CI insertion were relatively small and did not independently correlate well with hearing preservation, although at 250 Hz they added some significant information. Some tendencies-although no significant relationships-were detected between amplitude behavior and hearing preservation. Rising amplitudes seem favorable and falling amplitudes disadvantageous, but constant amplitudes do not appear to allow stringent predictions.Extracochlear ECochG measurements seem to only partially realize expected benefits. The questions now are: do gains justify the effort, and do other procedures or possible combinations lead to greater benefits for patients?\nPMID:\n38715410\n| PMC:\nPMC11080760\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241252240",

The study recruited 81 older adult hearing aid users between 60 and 95 years of age with bilateral moderate to severe hearing loss. The Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic (MoCA-BC) was used to screen older adults for mild cognitive impairment. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured using 2- to 5-digit sequences of the Mandarin iDIN. The differences in SRT between five-digit and two-digit sequences (SRT\n5-2\n), and between five-digit and three-digit sequences (SRT\n5-3\n), were used as indicators of memory performance. The results were compared to those from the Digit Span Test and Corsi Blocks Tapping Test, which evaluate WM and attention capacity. SRT\n5-2\nand SRT\n5-3\ndemonstrated significant correlations with the three cognitive function tests (\nr\ns ranging from -.705 to -.528). Furthermore, SRT\n5-2\nand SRT\n5-3\nwere significantly higher in participants who failed the MoCA-BC screening compared to those who passed.

Literature suggests that listening effort measures may be more sensitive to differences between hearing-device settings than established speech intelligibility measures when speech intelligibility is near maximum. Which method provides the most effective measurement of listening effort for this purpose is currently unclear. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of two tests for measuring changes in listening effort in CI users due to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) differences, as would arise from different hearing-device settings. By comparing the effect size of SNR differences on listening effort measures with test-retest differences, the study evaluated the suitability of these tests for clinical use. Nineteen CI users underwent two listening effort tests at two SNRs (+4 and +8 dB relative to individuals' 50% speech perception threshold). We employed dual-task paradigms-a sentence-final word identification and recall test (SWIRT) and a sentence verification test (SVT)-to assess listening effort at these two SNRs. Our results show a significant difference in listening effort between the SNRs for both test methods, although the effect size was comparable to the test-retest difference, and the sensitivity was not superior to speech intelligibility measures. Thus, the implementations of SVT and SWIRT used in this study are not suitable for clinical use to measure listening effort differences of this magnitude in individual CI users. However, they can be used in research involving CI users to analyze group data.\nPMID:\n38676325\n| PMC:\nPMC11055488\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241240572",

For hearing care, this means that hearing aid benefits can potentially be overshadowed by adverse experiences. Research has shown that sustaining focus on positive experiences has the potential to mitigate negativity bias. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether a positive focus (PF) intervention can improve speech-in-noise abilities for experienced hearing aid users. Thirty participants were randomly allocated to a control or PF group (N = 2 × 15). Prior to hearing aid fitting, all participants filled out the short form of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing scale (SSQ12) based on their own hearing aids. At the first visit, they were fitted with study hearing aids, and speech-in-noise testing was performed. Both groups then wore the study hearing aids for two weeks and sent daily text messages reporting hours of hearing aid use to an experimenter. In addition, the PF group was instructed to focus on positive listening experiences and to also report them in the daily text messages. After the 2-week trial, all participants filled out the SSQ12 questionnaire based on the study hearing aids and completed the speech-in-noise testing again. Speech-in-noise performance and SSQ12 Qualities score were improved for the PF group but not for the control group. This finding indicates that the PF intervention can improve subjective and objective hearing aid benefits.\nPMID:\n38656770\n| PMC:\nPMC11044800\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246616",

However, wearing hearing devices can also have negative effects on perception, previously demonstrated mostly for spatial hearing, sound quality and the perception of the own voice. When hearing devices are set to transparency, that is, provide no gain and resemble open-ear listening as well as possible, these side effects can be studied in isolation. In the present work, we conducted a series of experiments that are concerned with the effect of transparent hearing devices on speech perception in a collocated speech-in-noise task. In such a situation, listening through a hearing device is not expected to have any negative effect, since both speech and noise undergo identical processing, such that the signal-to-noise ratio at ear is not altered and spatial effects are irrelevant. However, we found a consistent hearing device disadvantage for speech intelligibility and similar trends for rated listening effort. Several hypotheses for the possible origin for this disadvantage were tested by including several different devices, gain settings and stimulus levels. While effects of self-noise and nonlinear distortions were ruled out, the exact reason for a hearing device disadvantage on speech perception is still unclear. However, a significant relation to auditory model predictions demonstrate that the speech intelligibility disadvantage is related to sound quality, and is most probably caused by insufficient equalization, artifacts of frequency-dependent signal processing and processing delays.\nPMID:\n38629486\n| PMC:\nPMC11025430\n| DOI:\n10.1177/23312165241246597",

For this purpose, we used two datasets with varying complexity and containing individual tracks of instrumental music. The first dataset contained trios and it was newly created and synthesized for this study. The second dataset contained orchestral music with a large number of instruments. Bilateral CI users and normal hearing listeners were asked to remix the multitracks grouped into melody, bass, accompaniment, and percussion. Remixes could be performed in the amplitude, spatial, and spectral domains. Results showed that CI users preferred tracks being panned toward the right side, especially the percussion component.

In addition to age, sex, environment, lifestyle, and comorbidities are all known to be related to ARHL as well. The prevalence of ARHL can be reduced by controlling the adjustable factors that cause it. Vitamin D levels are strongly related to calcium metabolism, which can affect ARHL. This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D and ARHL.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : A total of 1,104 subjects aged >65 years were enrolled from the fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was conducted from 2010-2012. Every participant received both an audiological assessment and a nutritional survey. The association between ARHL and serum vitamin D concentration was analyzed using logistic regression analyses with complex sampling adjusted for confounding factors such as alcohol consumption, smoking status, mobility, and bone mineral density.\nRESULTS: : Our multivariable analysis revealed that males in the group with lower serum levels of vitamin D (< 20 ng/mL) had a higher prevalence of ARHL (odds ratio, 1.638, 95% confidence interval, 1.058-2.538, p=0.027).\nCONCLUSIONS: : This finding suggests that lower serum levels of vitamin D are associated with ARHL in the older male population.\nPMID:\n38973327\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00458",

However, although relatively new, they are not well-established. In this article, we review DTx technologies in hearing research fields, focusing on three categories: prevention and diagnosis, aid (assistance), and cure (digital medicine). We observe that most DTx systems require interactions with users (or patients) without the direct support of clinical professionals to obtain or collect medical evidence; this makes training (or education) features crucial to the therapy's success. In this view, this article discusses the education or training functions of the current DTx and their contribution and purposes. The impact of emerging artificial intelligence (AI) on DTx in hearing research is being explored, and the future of DTx concerning AI integration is being discussed. We believe that this work will contribute to a better understanding of the current and future DTx technological advancements and, in particular, shed light on the field of hearing research.\nPMID:\n38973323\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00780",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : Localization of a sound source in the horizontal plane depends on the listener's interaural comparison of arrival time and level. Hearing loss (HL) can reduce access to these binaural cues, possibly disrupting the localization and memory of spatial information. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the horizontal sound localization performance and the spatial short-term memory in listeners with actual and simulated HL.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Seventeen listeners with bilateral symmetric HL and 17 listeners with normal hearing (NH) participated in the study. The hearing thresholds of NH listeners were elevated by a spectrally shaped masking noise for the simulations of unilateral hearing loss (UHL) and bilateral hearing loss (BHL). The localization accuracy and errors as well as the spatial short-term memory span were measured in the free field using a set of 11 loudspeakers arrayed over a 150° arc.\nRESULTS: : The localization abilities and spatial short-term memory span did not significantly differ between actual BHL listeners and BHL-simulated NH listeners. Overall, the localization performance with the UHL simulation was approximately twofold worse than that with the BHL simulation, and the hearing asymmetry led to a detrimental effect on spatial memory. The mean localization score as a function of stimulus location in the UHL simulation was less than 30% even for the front (0° azimuth) stimuli and much worse on the side closer to the simulated ear. In the UHL simulation, the localization responses were biased toward the side of the intact ear even when sounds were coming from the front.\nCONCLUSIONS: : Hearing asymmetry induced by the UHL simulation substantially disrupted the localization performance and recall abilities of spatial positions encoded and stored in the memory, due to fewer chances to learn strategies to improve localization. The marked effect of hearing asymmetry on sound localization highlights the need for clinical assessments of spatial hearing in addition to conventional hearing tests.\nPMID:\n38946331\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00206",

Patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy (AUVP) show a systematic SVV bias toward the affected side, whichever the side of line orientation. Whether SVV estimates are symmetrical has not been investigated.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : This study included 10 patients with AUVP (vestibular neuritis) and 10 with BPPV (posterior semicircular canal). SVV measurements were made at two preset angles of line orientation (15° and 30°) toward the ipsilateral and contralateral sides, relative to the affected side.\nRESULTS: : The results showed asymmetrical SVV estimates in the AUVP group, with significantly greater SVV errors for ipsilateral than contralateral line orientation, as well as for the preset angle of 30° compared to 15°. SVV estimates were significantly lower in patients with BPPV who also exhibited SVV asymmetry. SVV estimates remained unchanged just after the maneuver and were normalized some days later or after supplementary maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: : SVV asymmetry should be routinely considered in the clinic. We recommend individually assessing ipsilateral and contralateral SVV and using at least two preset angles. This allows for a better assessment and diagnosis of otolith organ imbalance that can trigger chronic instability and dizziness.

Intellectual ability is a crucial outcome determinant of a cochlear implant. The social quotient (SQ) is an indirect predictor of intellectual capacity and social skills. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of the SQ on children with additional needs who received cochlear implants. Subjects and.\nMETHODS: This study included 24 patients with diagnosed developmental delays and syndromes, who demonstrated SQ scores of <70. Preoperative social skills were evaluated using the SQ. All patients underwent cochlear implantation (CI) surgery before 7 years of age. Outcomes were evaluated using the Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS) and Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) scores. Data were collected through a retrospective chart review.\nRESULTS: Children were categorized into three groups based on their SQ. There were no correlations between the preoperative SQ and IT-MAIS or CAP scores at 2 and 5 years of follow-up postoperatively. The CI outcomes of children with low SQ (<70) differed from those with normal development (SQ>70). In the low-SQ group, inner ear anomalies were observed in 10 (41.7%) patients. Although not statistically significant, these children exhibited a trend of lower average outcomes than children without inner ear anomalies.\nCONCLUSIONS: CI outcomes in children with additional needs positively affected auditory performance. Postoperative auditory and language skills tended to improve slowly in children with additional needs and a lower SQ. Over time, development gradually became more comparable to the other groups of children. However, this improvement was less than that observed in children without additional needs.

Epub 2024 Apr 10.\nABSTRACT\nWe herein review the use of electrocochleography (ECoG) to assess peripheral auditory system responsiveness in a growing population of cochlear implant (CI) users with preserved hearing in ears with implants. Twenty-eight recently published intracochlear ECoG articles were thoroughly reviewed to investigate the prognostic utility of intraoperative ECoG monitoring to assess hearing preservation, and the clinical applicability of postoperative ECoG for estimating audiometric thresholds and monitoring longitudinal changes in residual acoustic hearing in patients with EAS. Intraoperative ECoG studies have focused on monitoring the changes in the cochlear microphonics (CM) amplitudes during and after electrode insertion. Mixed results have been reported regarding the relationship between changes in CM amplitude in the operating room and changes in hearing thresholds after surgery. Postoperative ECoG studies have shown that CM and auditory nerve neurophonics thresholds correlate significantly with behavioral thresholds. ECoG thresholds sensitively detect changes as residual acoustic hearing decreases over time in some CI users. This indicates its potential clinical value for monitoring the post-implantation status of the peripheral auditory system. Intracochlear ECoG can provide real-time intraoperative feedback and monitor postoperative hearing preservation in a growing population of CI users.\nPMID:\n38695055\n| PMC:\nPMC11065546\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00129",

Considering the genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of SNHL, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has revolutionized knowledge on its genomic architecture. Nonetheless, the conventional application of panel and exome sequencing in real-world practice is being challenged by the emerging need to explore the diagnostic capability of whole-genome sequencing, which enables the detection of both noncoding and structural variations. Small molecules and gene therapies represent good examples of how breakthroughs in genetic understanding can be translated into targeted therapies for SNHL. For example, targeted small molecules have been used to ameliorate autoinflammatory hearing loss caused by gain-of-function variants of NLRP3 and inner ear proteinopathy with OSBPL2 variants underlying dysfunctional autophagy. Strikingly, the successful outcomes of the first-in-human trial of OTOF gene therapy highlighted its potential in the treatment of various forms of genetic hearing loss. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies are currently being developed for site-specific genome editing to treat human genetic disorders. These advancements have led to an era of genotype- and mechanism-based precision medicine in SNHL practice.\nPMID:\n38695053\n| PMC:\nPMC11065549\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00157",

When evaluating young children for cochlear implantation, there are unique considerations beyond the standard issues addressed during surgery in adults. Because of advances in genetic testing, imaging resolution, CI technology, post-implant rehabilitation, and other factors, issues related to CI surgery in children continue to evolve. Such factors have led to changes in candidacy guidelines, vaccine requirements, and lowering of age requirement for surgery. In addition, differences in the anatomy and physiology of infants require special attention to ensure safety when operating on young children. This review summarizes these issues and provides guidance for surgeons treating children with SNHL.\nPMID:\n38695052\n| PMC:\nPMC11065545\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2024.00073",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: : The temporal structure of sound, characterized by regular patterns, plays a crucial role in optimizing the processing of auditory information. The meter, representing a well-organized sequence of evenly spaced beats in music, exhibits a hierarchical arrangement, with stronger beats occupying higher metrical positions. Moreover, the meter has been shown to influence behavioral and neural processing, particularly the N1, P2, and mismatch negativity components. However, the role of the P1 component in the context of metrical hierarchy remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component and compare the responses between musicians and non-musicians.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Thirty participants (15 musicians and 15 non-musicians) were enrolled in the study. Auditory stimuli consisted of a synthesized speech syllable presented together with a repeating series of four tones, establishing a quadruple meter. Electrophysiological recordings were performed to measure the P1 component.\nRESULTS: : The results revealed that metrical position had a significant effect on P1 amplitude, with the strongest beat showing the lowest amplitude. This contrasts with previous findings, in which enhanced P1 responses were typically observed at on-the-beat positions. The reduced P1 response on the strong beat can be interpreted within the framework of predictive coding and temporal prediction, where a higher predictability of pitch changes at the strong beat leads to a reduction in the P1 response. Furthermore, higher P1 amplitudes were observed in musicians compared to non-musicians, suggesting that musicians have enhanced sensory processing.\nCONCLUSIONS: : This study demonstrates the effects of metrical hierarchy on the P1 component, thereby enriching our understanding of auditory processing. The results suggest that predictive coding and temporal prediction play important roles in shaping sensory processing. Further, they suggest that musical training may enhance P1 responses.\nPMID:\n38685834\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00262",

The present study examined cognitive function in CI users by employing a web-based cognitive testing platform, i.e., BrainCheck, and explored the correlation between cognitive function and subjective evaluation of hearing.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: : Forty-two CI users (mean age: 58.90 years) were surveyed in the subjective evaluation of hearing, and 20/42 participated in the BrainCheck cognitive tests (immediate recognition, Trail Making A, Trail Making B, Stroop, digit symbol substitution, and delayed recognition). As controls for cognitive function, young normal-hearing (YNH, mean age=23.83 years) and older normal-hearing (ONH, mean age=52.67 years) listener groups were subjected to Brain- Check testing.\nRESULTS: : CI users exhibited poorer cognitive function than the normal hearing groups in all tasks except for immediate and delayed recognition. The highest percentage of CI users who had \"possible\" and \"likely\" cognitive impairment, based on BrainCheck scores (ranging from 0-200), was observed in tests assessing executive function. The composite cognitive score across domains tended to be related to subjective hearing (p=0.07).\nCONCLUSIONS: : The findings of the current study suggest that CI users had a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment in the executive function domain than in lower-level domains.

Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to systematically review publications on hearing disorders and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were observational or interventional studies on audiological assessment in participants who were using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Meta-Analysis of Statistics: assessment and review Instrument. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,372 non-duplicate papers were screened, out of which 17 were included in the final qualitative synthesis, and 5 studies in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio for the two subgroups evaluated did not show significance with no heterogeneity between the effects observed between the different diseases (I2=0%) and obtaining the global estimate of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.41-1.39; p>0.05). Despite the inclusion of papers with different disease samples, the heterogeneity observed in the analysis was low (I2= 0%) and prediction interval (95% PI=0.32-1.80; p>0.05) remained close to that estimated by the CI (95% CI=0.41-1.39; p>0.05). The certainty of the evidence assessed by the GRADE tool was considered very low due to the risk of bias, indirect evidence, and imprecision.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is not associated with hearing disorders.\nPMID:\n38382520\n| PMC:\nPMC11065553\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00157",

Epub 2024 Feb 22.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are low-intensity sounds generated by the cochlea and associated with the function of the outer hair cells. Since OAE measurements do not require active participation of a listener, OAEs are considered an objective measure of cochlear function. While distortion-product OAEs (DPOAEs) are commonly used in clinical practice, limited information is available on the performance of various clinical devices. This study compared two commercial clinical devices, Titan and Eclipse from Interacoustics, and collected normative data for DPOAEs in people with normal hearing. The data collection and analysis were focused on signal and noise amplitudes as well as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three participants with normal hearing (age 23.2±2.0 years) were included in the study. DPOAEs were measured at 31 frequencies ranging from 500 to 10,000 Hz.\nRESULTS: DPOAE amplitude differed across frequencies. Additionally, a high number of unreliable responses were observed at the edge frequencies (<828 Hz and >6,072 Hz). There were no significant differences between the two devices in terms of DPOAE amplitudes, but the recorded-noise levels (amplitude) differed significantly. SNRs of the recorded OAEs were frequency dependent (higher frequencies showed larger SNRs), and significant differences in terms of SNR were found between the two devices.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the above-mentioned differences, the OAEs recorded with both devices met the pass criteria for the SNR (≥6 dB) consistently across frequencies, and thus the differences do not compromise the test outcomes. The frequency dependence of the OAE amplitudes and the corresponding SNRs may be relevant for clinical practice.\nPMID:\n38382519\n| PMC:\nPMC11065547\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00269",

However, whether musicianship provides an advantage for the listening effort (LE) required to comprehend speech in degraded environments has received less attention. The current study aimed to understand the influence of Indian classical music training on SIN perception and its related LE across percussionists, non-percussionists, and non-musicians.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: A quasi-experiment was conducted on 16 percussionists, 17 non-percussionists, and 26 non-musicians aged 18-35 years with normal hearing. In phase 1, musical abilities were assessed using Mini-Profile of Music Perception Skills (Mini-PROMS). Phase 2 examined SIN using Tamil Phonemically-Balanced Words and Tamil Matrix Sentence Test at +5 dB, 0 dB, and -5 dB SNR and LE using pupillometry, measuring pupil dilations with an eye-tracker.\nRESULTS: Fractional Logit and Linear Regression models demonstrated that percussionists outperformed non-percussionists in Tuning and Speed subsets of Mini-PROMS. Percussionists outperformed non-percussionists and non-musicians in SIN and LE at -5 dB SNR for words and at 0 dB and -5 dB SNR for sentences.\nCONCLUSIONS: Percussionists have the greatest advantage in decoding SIN with reduced LE followed by non-percussionists and non-musicians, demonstrating musician-advantage in most challenging listening conditions.\nPMID:\n38382518\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00248",

Notably, they are often misdiagnosed because their symptoms mimic those of other, more common inner ear pathologies. Diagnosis requires high-resolution contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which reveals filling defects (using a T2-weighted MRI sequence) or focal enhancement (using a T1-weighted MRI sequence with gadolinium enhancement) in the inner ear. A 52-year-old male patient with intractable vertigo or single-sided deafness should raise suspicion of this clinical entity as a differential diagnosis. Translabyrinthine excision of the tumor along with auditory rehabilitation using a cochlear implant can provide good outcomes with minimal morbidity in carefully selected cases. Here, we present an interesting case of a transmodiolar ILS mimicking Meniere's disease, wherein surgery using the translabyrinthine approach and an extended cochleostomy yielded favorable outcomes.\nPMID:\n38382517\n| PMC:\nPMC11065550\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00304",

Although etiologic factors, including viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and vascular issues, contribute to the understanding of SSNHL, the condition remains unclear in most cases. Systemic steroids are often used as the first-line treatment because they reduce inner ear inflammation; however, there remains numerous discussions about the effectiveness of alternative treatments. To predict hearing recovery is crucial in patients' counseling with factors, including delayed treatment, vertigo, and other health conditions, which indicate poor prognosis.

This study aimed to identify changing trends in distributions of hearing threshold levels across ages by comparing the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7029 and newly available data after publishing ISO 7029. To compare ISO 7029 and newly available hearing threshold data after publishing ISO 7029, four country-specific datasets that presented average hearing threshold levels under conditions similar to ISO 7029 were utilized. For frequencies between 125 Hz and 8,000 Hz, the deviations of hearing threshold values by ages from the hearing threshold of the youngest age group for each data point were utilized. For frequencies from 9,000 Hz to 12,500 Hz, the median threshold information was utilized. Hearing threshold data reported after publishing ISO 7029 from the four countries were mostly similar to the ISO 7029 data but tended to deviate in some age groups and sexes. As national hearing threshold trends change, the following ISO 7029 revision suggests the need to integrate hearing threshold data from different countries.\nPMID:\n38254303\n| PMC:\nPMC10808389\n| DOI:\n10.7874/jao.2023.00626",

The purpose of this study was to validate a pediatric version of the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire (P-SHQ) for determining binaural hearing benefits and spatial hearing ability in children.\nMETHOD: We recruited parents and guardians of 68 children ages kindergarten through eighth grade to participate. Parents completed the P-SHQ, the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale-Parent version, and a demographic questionnaire. To determine the factor structure of the P-SHQ, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis and reliability was assessed by calculating correlation coefficients.\nRESULTS: Three factors emerged during factor analysis: Factor 1 = sound localization, Factor 2 = speech-in-noise perception, and Factor 3 = speech perception in quiet. The P-SHQ has good internal consistency reliability (α = .97), and high item-total correlations were found. The correlation between scores from the P-SHQ questionnaire and the SSQ-Spatial subscale questionnaire provides evidence for the construct validity of the P-SHQ.\nCONCLUSIONS: The P-SHQ is a reliable and valid questionnaire to assess spatial hearing ability in children. This quick-to-administer tool can be incorporated into audiological care to determine the spatial hearing skills of a child and assist in counseling, making it a valuable assessment for hearing health care professionals.\nPMID:\n39058953\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00009",

The specific objectives were to identify and report the test protocol used, identify the most common timeline of follow-up, and identify barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of the monitoring program.\nMETHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted across six electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. The scoping review method adhered to relevant guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and frameworks. The database search was carried out by two independent researchers, and studies were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nRESULTS: This scoping review identified 13 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study. Only one study reported findings from the perspective of ototoxicity monitoring. Another study explicitly mentioned that ototoxicity monitoring was a standard of care in their hospital. Only one study reported using the relevant guidelines for monitoring ototoxicity. Specialized tests such as high-frequency audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and vestibular tests were rarely used.

The hearing screening test was conducted using neckband earphones of a Bluetooth self-fitting device controlled by a smartphone app. The hearing screening tests were compared with the pure-tone audiometry in an audiometric booth. The amplification benefits of the self-fitting program-aided condition were evaluated and compared with those of unaided and preset program-aided conditions using the Mandarin Hearing in Noise Test (MHINT) and questionnaires.\nRESULTS: The pure-tone audiometry and hearing screening test results exhibited strong positive correlations at all test frequencies. In the environment with 90° noise, the sentence reception thresholds (SRTs) obtained for the self-fitting program-aided condition were significantly lower (\np\n= .032) than those obtained for the unaided condition, whereas no significant difference was observed between the preset program-aided and the unaided conditions. Moreover, the participants' satisfaction ratings for the devices were consistent with their MHINT results, with a strong positive correlation observed between satisfaction with self-fitting and user satisfaction in smartphone app's control, functionality, and learning.

The objective of this review was to systematically summarize and critically appraise existing evidence of the prognostic value of eCAP, eABR, and MRI for predicting post-cochlear implant (CI) speech perception outcomes in children, with a particular focus on the lesion site.\nMETHOD: The present systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 statement. Three electronic databases (ProQuest, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched with no restrictions on language, publication status, or year of publication. Studies on children identified with sensorineural hearing loss, auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder, cochlear nerve deficiency, or cochleovestibular nerve abnormalities reporting the relevance of eCAP, eABR, and/or MRI results to CI speech perception outcomes were included. The literature search yielded 1,887 publications. Methodological quality and strength of evidence were assessed by the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool, respectively.\nRESULTS: Of the 25 included studies, the relevance of eCAP, eABR, and/or MRI findings to post-CI speech perception outcomes was reported in 10, 11, and 11 studies, respectively. The studies were strongly in support of the prognostic value of eABR and MRI for CI outcomes. However, the relevance of eCAP findings to speech perception outcomes was uncertain.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the promising findings, caution is warranted in interpreting them due to the observational and retrospective design of the included studies, as well as the heterogeneity of the population and the limited control of confounding factors within these studies.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26169859.\nPMID:\n39018270\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00272",

Here, we show that there are significant differences in the scores that previous studies have reported for headphone and insert-phone transducers on the Words-in-Noise (WIN) Test, and discuss the possibility that the variations in high-frequency output that are allowable under the speech source specifications of American National Standards Institute S3.6 might be contributing to transducer-dependent differences in performance for the WIN and other tests that are presented through the auxiliary input channels of clinical audiometers.\nMETHOD: A literature review was conducted to identify articles that reported WIN Test results for both listeners with normal hearing and with hearing impairment and specified the type of transducer (insert or TDH-50) used for the data collection.\nRESULTS: Among the 19 included studies, participants with normal hearing using inserts exhibited systematically worse WIN Test scores compared to those using TDH-50 headphones, while participants with hearing loss showed comparable average scores across transducer types.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering transducer type when interpreting WIN Test outcomes, particularly when comparing to normative scores obtained from individuals with normal hearing. Although further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving differences in test performance across transducer types, these findings underscore the need for standardized test administration protocols and careful documentation of transducer type when administering speech-in-noise tests for clinical or research applications.\nPMID:\n38995872\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00055",

The participant and two researchers then met in a moderately noisy and reverberant food court at a local mall where the participant was asked to listen to a conversation between the two researchers. Participants rated the extent of their agreement with 10 positively worded statements specific to the conversation twice, once for each program. Participants then provided program-preference ratings for seven different aspects of a conversation during which the programs were switched back and forth by the researcher, so that participants were unaware of the condition to which they were listening.\nRESULTS: Real-world subjective ratings for all domains resulted in positive values on average for both programs. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the intervention algorithm had higher absolute ratings on five of the 10 criteria including understanding, clarity, focus, listening effort, and background noise. Ratings for preference between programs indicated a significant preference for the intervention algorithm for all seven criteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, the use of hearing aids with separate processing of sounds from the front and back hemisphere provided positive subjective ratings. However, following a group conversation with multiple conversation partners, improvements in the algorithm to account for the locations of interlocutors and the natural head turning of the hearing aid wearer that occurs during a conversation by adding and controlling multiple adaptive beams in the front hemisphere significantly influenced preference for all aspects rated.\nPMID:\n38984919\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00027",

The MSTB has been widely used by clinicians as a guide for cochlear implant (CI) candidacy evaluations and to document post-operative speech recognition performance. Due to changes in candidacy over the past 10 years, a revision to the MSTB was needed.\nMETHOD: In 2022, the Institute for Cochlear Implant Training (ICIT) recruited a panel of expert CI audiologists to update and revise the MSTB. This panel utilized a modified Delphi consensus process to revise the test battery and to improve its applicability considering recent changes in CI care.\nRESULTS: This resulted in the MTSB-Version 3 (MSTB-3), which includes test protocols for identifying not only traditional CI candidates but also possible candidates for electric-acoustic stimulation and patients with single-sided deafness and asymmetric hearing loss. The MSTB-3 provides information that supplements the earlier versions of the MSTB, such as recommendations of when to refer patients for a CI, recommended patient-reported outcome measures, considerations regarding the use of cognitive screeners, and sample report templates for clinical documentation of pre- and post-operative care. Electronic versions of test stimuli, along with all the materials described above, will be available to clinicians via the ICIT website.\nCONCLUSION: The goal of the MSTB-3 is to be an evidence-based test battery that will facilitate a streamlined standard of care for adult CI candidates and recipients that will be widely used by CI clinicians.\nPMID:\n38980836\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00008",

This study aimed to address a research gap by investigating sources and levels of occupational stress in U.K. audiologists.\nMETHOD: A mixed-methods cross-sectional design and convenience sampling were utilized. The study used the Audiologist Occupational Stress Questionnaire (AOSQ) and an audiological working practices questionnaire. The study included 100 registered U.K. audiologists.\nRESULTS: The research revealed that over a third of participants reported experiencing moderate or higher levels of occupational stress. Pediatric audiologists and those with a high daily patient load reported significantly higher stress scores than other specialties and those seeing fewer patients per day. Identified sources of stress for U.K. audiologists included clinical demands and time constraints, staffing issues, leadership in the workplace, and equipment availability. Reported impacts of stress encompassed mental health issues, fatigue, social life disruptions, and physical health concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS: The research validated the use of the AOSQ in a U.K. setting, and the findings provided insights into the sources and levels of occupational stress experienced by U.K. audiologists, supporting existing research on occupational stress in audiologists in other countries. The identification of consistent stress themes across the literature underscores the need for targeted support and interventions to ensure the well-being of audiologists and empower them in maintaining their pivotal role in health care.\nPMID:\n38963786\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00024",

(2014), the current study aimed to expand the original study's findings-that SoTL was rarely published in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) literature from 2009 to 2013-to the subsequent 8-year period (2014-2021). The latter period was of particular relevance considering the dissolution of one American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)-affiliated publication and the addition of another non-ASHA-affiliated publication during that time.\nMETHOD: Ten peer-reviewed CSD journals and the articles published in them were identified via a survey of the literature that used narrowly defined criteria developed in collaboration with a librarian. Five trained CSD graduate student raters compared a definition of SoTL to article abstracts to determine whether each should have been categorized as SoTL. Part 1 of the study investigated an 8-year time span, Part 2 investigated the remaining nine journals in the subsequent 5 years, and Part 3 investigated publication rates of SoTL in\nTeaching and Learning in Communication Sciences & Disorders\n(\nTLCSD\n) alone.\nRESULTS: Part 1 of the study revealed that publication rates of SoTL were extremely low in the 10 surveyed CSD journals in the 8-year time span investigated. A similar and diminishing trend was found in Part 2. Even smaller percentages of journals were dedicated to SoTL. Part 3 confirmed that relatively large amounts of CSD-specific SoTL have been published in\nTLCSD\nsince its inception in 2017.\nCONCLUSIONS: As of 2021, SoTL articles continued to be uncommonly published in CSD journals.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Specific learning disorder (SLD) refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by problems with reading, writing, or mathematics that are not solely due to intellectual disabilities, sensory deficits, or other neurological or medical conditions. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the processing and organizing of information. Auditory and cognitive processing is affected in most children with SLD, although to a varying degree. However, it is still unclear whether there exists any relationship between auditory and cognitive processing disorders in children with SLD.\nMETHOD: We tested 1,259 children, of whom 77 were diagnosed as SLD and 30 age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) children were selected. Auditory processing abilities were assessed for auditory discrimination, pattern perception, closure, temporal processing, binaural integration, and separation using standardized tests and procedures. Cognitive processing was measured using working memory, short-term memory, and attention tasks.\nRESULTS: The test data of the TD children were taken as the norm. Based on the normative range, children with SLD were divided into those with auditory processing disorder (APD;\nn\n= 31) and those without APD (\nn\n= 46). A regression model highlighted a robust positive relationship between APD and cognitive processing, particularly pronounced in SLD with APD children. The results are discussed, supporting the information-processing theory of learning disability and highlighting a complex loop between auditory and cognitive deficits in children with SLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the critical role of both auditory and cognitive abilities in children with SLD. Tailoring the intervention to break the loop is recommended, which may improve learning abilities more effectively.\nPMID:\n38959167\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00001",

It is a powerful research tool but can be complex and challenging for beginners. Application of EMA in audiological research brings with it opportunities and challenges that differ from other research disciplines. This tutorial discusses important considerations when conducting EMA studies in hearing care. While more research is needed to develop specific guidelines for the various potential applications of EMA in hearing research, we hope this article can alert hearing researchers new to EMA to pitfalls when using EMA and help strengthen their study design. The current article elaborates study design details, such as choice of participants, representativeness of the study period for participants' lives, and balancing participant burden with data requirements. Mobile devices and sensors to collect objective data on the acoustic situation are reviewed alongside different possibilities for EMA setups ranging from online questionnaires paired with a timer to proprietary apps that also have access to parameters of a hearing device. In addition to considerations for survey design, a list of questionnaire items from previous studies is provided. For each item, an example and a list of references are given. EMA typically provides data sets that are rich but also challenging in that they are noisy, and there is often unequal amount of data between participants. After recommendations on how to check the data for compliance, reactivity, and careless responses, methods for statistical analysis on the individual level and on the group level are discussed including special methods for direct comparison of hearing device programs.\nPMID:\n38950171\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00249",

Additionally, all participants completed the Turkish version of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) questionnaire.\nRESULTS: Wrestlers with cauliflower ears exhibited significantly higher hearing thresholds, particularly at frequencies above 4000 Hz (\np\n< .05). Analysis of EEC resonance showed a shift to higher frequencies in the second resonance peak of the right ear (\np\n< .001) and the first resonance peak of the left ear (\np\n= .045). SSQ scores revealed that wrestlers had higher spatial perception (\np\n= .046), hearing quality (\np\n= .004), and general scores (\np\n= .042) in comparison to the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Blunt traumas in wrestlers, leading to cauliflower ear, can result in hearing loss. Moreover, deformities in the external ear affect the resonance frequencies of the EEC. Therefore, it is crucial to advocate for the use of ear protection equipment among wrestlers. When fitting hearing aids, attention should be given to changes in the EEC resonance frequency.\nPMID:\n38917152\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00277",

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted up until June 30, 2023.\nRESULTS: Primary outcomes focused on complete resolution of vertiginous symptoms measured by either a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or the Dix-Hallpike (DH) test. Secondary outcomes included conversion of a positive DH test to a negative DH test exclusively looking at positional nystagmus and assessment of side effects (cervical/back pain, posttreatment dizziness, and nausea). Both outcomes were assessed within a maximum of 4-week follow-up. Following systematic search and review, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs;\np\n= .413) were found. The studies reported on the effectiveness of the Epley maneuver compared to three other specific RM: Semont, Li, and Gans maneuvers. Results revealed a low to very low certainty of evidence. With the primary outcomes, Epley maneuver was superior to Gans maneuver 24-hr posttreatment but not after 1 week. No significant differences were found between the remaining maneuvers.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, evidence of low to very low certainty indicates that Epley maneuver is comparable with Semont, Gans, and Li maneuvers for vertiginous symptoms in patients with P-BPPV. Further high-quality studies are needed.\nPMID:\n38900988\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00177",

Thirty young adults age 18-30 years (16 men, 14 women by self-identification) completed sinusoidal harmonic acceleration testing in a rotary chair under five different conditions, each at three rotational frequencies (0.01, 0.08, and 0.32 Hz). We recorded gain as the ratio of the amplitude of eye movement to chair movement using standard clinical procedures. The five conditions consisted of two without spatial information (silence, tasking via headphones) and three with either auditory (refrigerator sound, tasking via speaker) or somatosensory (fan) information. Two of the conditions also included mental tasking (tasking via headphones, tasking via speaker) and differed only in terms of the spatial localizability of the verbal instructions. We used linear mixed-effects modeling to compare pairs of conditions, specifically examining the effects of the availability of spatial cues in the environment. This study was preregistered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2gqcf/).\nRESULTS: Results showed significant effects of frequency in all conditions (\np\n< .05), but the only pairs of conditions that were significantly different were those including tasking in one condition but not the other (e.g., tasking via headphones vs. silence). Post hoc equivalence testing showed that the lack of significance in the other comparisons could be confirmed as not meaningfully different.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the presence of externally localizable sensory information, whether auditory or somatosensory, does not affect measures of gain in RCT to any relevant degree. However, these findings also contribute to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that mental engagement (\"tasking\") does increase gain whether or not it is provided via localizable instructions.\nPMID:\n38896881\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00017",

These participants were assessed using two standard protocols in a randomized order.\nRESULTS: Results from 77 participants (\nM\nage\n= 46 years; 43 women, 34 men) were analyzed. Pearson's correlation coefficient and simple linear regression indicated a statistically significant relationship between crHIT gain output and age (\np\n> .05) for right gain, 1030°/s\n2\n, and left gain, 1005°/s\n2\n. Although a statistically significant relationship was found, the slope was minor, demonstrating that the clinical effect of age on crHIT gain output was insignificant. Furthermore, no statistically significant relationship exists between crHIT gain output and gender (\np\n> .05). Age-dependent normative data were calculated using the 2.5th and 97.5th confidence interval (CI) percentile method. The responses of angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) gain values for crHIT are expected to occur within the range for lower limit reference interval (RI) of 0.85-0.9 and upper limit RI of 1.11-1.18 for 1030°/s\n2\nand lower limit RI of 0.86-0.92 and upper limit RI of 1.13-1.16 for 1005°/s\n2\n. It can be expected that 90% CI of the population with normal lateral SCC functioning will have aVOR gain values that fall within this range.\nCONCLUSION: Despite a statistically significant relationship that exists with aVOR gain output and age, the changes are minor, declining by 0.0088 units per 10 years, justifying the same normative data for all decade age bands.\nPMID:\n38889375\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-22-00190",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Most modern hearing aids (HAs) employ wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) and noise reduction (NR) algorithms. It is known that the nonlinear effects of WDRC and NR cause changes to the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an HA. However, the relative contributions of WDRC and NR to the nonlinear effects are not fully understood. The current study investigated (a) whether WDRC or NR dominates the nonlinear effects measured at the output of a digital HA and (b) whether the electroacoustic effectiveness of NR depends on WDRC parameters while input SNR and background noise are systematically varied.\nMETHOD: Test stimuli were Connected Speech Test sentences in multitalker babble noise (2- or 20-talker), presented at input SNRs ranging from -10 to +10 dB. The HA was programmed using multiband WDRC set according to the National Acoustic Laboratories for Nonlinear HA fitting formula 2 prescriptive fits for four standard audiograms and two compression speeds. The NR algorithm of the HA was switched on or off in separate conditions. Nonlinear electroacoustic effects from the WDRC and NR algorithms were assessed by measuring the output SNR of the HA using a phase-inversion technique. To investigate whether there are other factors that may be important besides the output SNR, the Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index were applied to the recordings to generate inferences on aided speech intelligibility and perceived speech quality.\nRESULTS: Results showed that WDRC dominated the net nonlinear effect at low-input SNRs, and the net nonlinear effect of WDRC and NR was reduced at high-input SNRs. Results also showed that the effectiveness of NR depended on compression parameters. The effectiveness of NR was partially explained by the trend of Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index scores, potentially indicating that the Hearing Aid Speech Intelligibility Index and Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index scores may capture factors that cannot be captured by the output SNR metric.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the individual signal-processing stages in an HA should not be considered as independent. Electroacoustic evaluation of WDRC and NR algorithms in isolation is not sufficient to capture the combined nonlinear effect of the two algorithms.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25962541.\nPMID:\n38875482\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00011",

The goal of this systematic review was to ascertain the percentage of studies conducted in the United States in the past 2 decades that reported relevant demographic variables.\nMETHOD: Studies were searched across eight databases and clinical trial registries in October 2022. Variations of the following search strings were used to retrieve peer-reviewed published studies and unpublished clinical trials: children, hearing loss, and intervention.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine intervention studies met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies were reviewed and coded for the following demographic variables: area and type of intervention, participant age, hearing technology data, sample size, gender, race/skin color and ethnicity, primary/home language(s), additional disabilities, parental education, family income, and parental occupation. Results revealed that many demographic variables were remarkably underreported, with parental education, family income, and parental occupation variables being the least reported data.\nCONCLUSIONS: Demographic data can be an important tool for changing disparities related to intervention outcomes. This systematic review suggests that inclusive research practices should be extended to low-literacy or low-economic resources, non-White, and non-English-speaking groups. Inclusion practices coupled with sufficient sample sizes will ultimately aid in identifying hearing health disparities.\nPMID:\n38861427\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00208",

Here, we evaluated one such system from TympaHealth by comparing air conduction thresholds and resultant hearing aid targets and output, measured with the TympaHealth system with those measured using standard audiometry.\nDESIGN: The hearing thresholds of 35 adults were measured using standard audiometry and the TympaHealth system. Each set of thresholds was used to generate NAL-NL2 targets and program a hearing aid. The data from each system were compared.\nRESULTS: Bland-Altman analyses showed overall mean differences between thresholds measured with each system to be small, with 85% of TympaHealth thresholds being within ±5 dB of the standard audiometric thresholds, although TympaHealth thresholds were higher (poorer) than the standard audiometric thresholds. The hearing aid targets and gains generated from the standard audiometric thresholds were lower (less amplification) than those generated from the TympaHealth thresholds but again, mean differences at each frequency were small and likely imperceptible.\nCONCLUSION: These findings support the possibility that valid hearing testing can take place outside of a clinical booth using portable systems like that from TympaHealth, opening up the possibility of testing hearing and fitting hearing aids through pharmacies, opticians, and in care homes.\nPMID:\n38848255\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-24-00002",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to assess how age influences masseter vestibular evoked myogenic potential (mVEMP) parameters by utilizing 500-Hz tone burst stimuli delivered through air conduction.\nMETHOD: The study involved 110 participants ranging from 15 to 60 years of age, grouped into five categories, all of whom had no previous issues related to their vestibular system. The participants were exposed to 500-Hz tone burst stimuli at 125 dB SPL through ER-3A inserts. These stimuli were presented to one ear at a time, with alternating polarity. A Tukey's honestly significant difference test was conducted to compare rectified and unrectified amplitude, along with latencies (P11 and N21) and the asymmetric ratio across all age groups. Additionally, a multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the impact of sex on the study variables.\nRESULTS: All 110 participants (220 ears) in the study provided mVEMP responses, encompassing 100% of the subjects. The results revealed a significant reduction in both amplitude and latency extension for the P11 and N21 peaks. Interestingly, P11 latency was also prolonged in the youngest participants (Group 1), suggesting ongoing maturation of the system even beyond the age of 16 years. Moreover, a significant sex difference was observed in the P11 latencies. However, there were no substantial sex differences (\np\n> .05) in N1 peak latency, peak-to-peak amplitude, rectified amplitude, and asymmetric ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: Changes in structure occur due to degeneration, and the quantity of vestibular sensory hair cells gradually diminishes with age. The rate of decline is faster in semicircular canals compared to end organs, as observed by Merchant et al. (2000). Following a linear degeneration starting at the age of 40 years, a continuous reduction in sensory cells and primary neurons takes place until approximately 40% of vestibular sensory cells are lost by the age of 75 years and insufficient maturation can lead to prolonged peaks and reduced amplitudes compared with those that are considered normal. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the age of the participants when making diagnoses and incorporate relevant correction factors based on age-related reference data.\nPMID:\n38843439\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00264",

Pure-tone hearing averages did not significantly differ among those with or without MCI after adjusting for age, sex, and race (\np\ns ≥ .292).\nCONCLUSIONS: AP in the binaural domain is impaired in MCI, but peripheral hearing did not significantly differ between those with and without MCI. Poor performance on AP measures of binaural processing may reflect problems dividing attention and may be indicative of dementia risk. Results have clinical implications for early detection of and intervention for cognitive impairment.\nPMID:\n38787303\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00166",

Understanding the hearing aid needs of individuals with hearing loss is important to support uptake, use, and outcomes. The current study describes users' perspectives on how hearing aids can be improved.\nMETHOD: A cross-sectional, qualitative, content analysis design was used for an open-ended question from an online survey, exploring user perspectives on hearing aid improvements. Participants were adult hearing aid users in the United States, surveyed from the HearingTracker and Lexie Hearing user database.\nRESULTS: A total of 628 participants (\nM\nage\n= 66 years) were surveyed. The majority of participants used bilateral, behind-the-ear hearing aids that were obtained either through a hearing health care professional or online. Three domains, highlighting areas for hearing aid improvement, were identified. (a) The hearing aid features domain described user issues surrounding physical appearance and fit, general features, streaming, battery functionality, adjustments, smartphone applications, and hearing aid-related accessories. There was dissatisfaction with aesthetics and functionality, with a notable desire for improvements in physical appearance and fit (\nn\n= 161), and features to improve self-efficacy. (b) The sound quality domain described user issues surrounding sound perception and difficult situations. Participants highlighted unmet needs for clarity, especially in noisy environments (\nn\n= 143). (c) The service-delivery domain described user issues surrounding audiology services and general satisfaction, with criticisms centered on the high cost of hearing aids (\nn\n= 193) and the credibility of hearing health care professionals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hearing aid users appreciated current technological advances but expressed a need for improvements, to better align devices with their requirements. Key areas included physical aesthetics, user control over device adjustments, sound clarity, cost accessibility, and trust between the user and hearing health care professional. Future designs should focus on features enhancing user autonomy and self-efficacy.\nPMID:\n38768085\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00245",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the short- and long-term effects of a new cognitive sound exposure therapy (CSET) in patients with hyperacusis.\nMETHOD: A new therapy was developed to reduce hyperacusis using sound exposure combined with breathing and relaxation strategies from both acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Patients who were referred to the Speech and Hearing Centers located in Hengelo and Zwolle in the Netherlands and aged ≥ 18 years with hyperacusis as main complaint and no or mild hearing loss were included in this study. Patients were seen for CSET between June 2020 and August 2022. The sessions took place biweekly. Sessions ended when exposure reached a level with a maximum of 70-80 dB SPL. Short-term effects between the start and the end of therapy were based on tolerable level of sound exposure (dB SPL), subjective-level hinderance of hyperacusis, and sensitivity to sound using the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). The long-term effect was based on HQ 6 months after the end of therapy. Linear mixed-effects and regression models were applied to study outcomes over time.\nRESULTS: In total, 30 patients, 15 men and 15 women, aged between 24 and 76 years were included in this study. The mean number of sessions during therapy was 6 and ranged between 4 and 8. Results showed an increase of exposure level (mean change was +23.7 dB with an\nSD\nof 7.9,\np\n< .001), a decrease in sensitivity to daily sounds (mean [\nSD\n] change was -1.6 [2.1],\np\n< .001), and a decrease in HQ (mean [\nSD\n] change was -9.8 [4.9],\np\n< .001), between the start and the end of therapy. There was no significant change in HQ after the end of therapy and 6 months later; mean (\nSD\n) change was 0.2 (4.3),\np\n= .81.\nCONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of CSET indicated a decrease in short- and long-term sensitivity to sound in patients with hyperacusis. Additionally, CSET has shown a positive impact, not only for the sounds used in the therapy sessions but also in transferring benefits to everyday sounds. The results of combining psychoeducation, sound exposure, and counseling are promising and warrant further evaluation.\nPMID:\n38768075\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00210",

In this study, we measured the association of drive times to the nearest audiologist with population density, income, ethnicity, race, and distance to the nearest audiology graduate program.\nMETHOD: Drive times for each census block group to the nearest audiologist were measured using census data, the National Provider Identifier Registry, and a geographic analyzing tool called ArcGIS for all block groups within the United States. The association between drive times and population density, income, ethnicity, race, and audiology program distance was evaluated with a population density-matched case-control study and multiple linear regression analyses.\nRESULTS: Approximately 5.29 million Americans need to drive at least 1 hr to visit their closest audiologist. The 10% most rural-dwelling Americans drive an average of 33.8 min. The population density-matched case-control study demonstrated that percent below poverty, percent identifying as Hispanic, and travel times to the nearest audiology program were all significantly higher in census block groups with high drive times to the nearest audiologist. An average of 7.96% of individuals in census block groups with low drive times identified as Hispanic, but 18.8% identified as Hispanic in high drive time groups. The multiple linear regression showed that the effect of demographics and distance to the nearest audiology program was highest in rural areas. In both analyses, adjusting for poverty did not drastically change the effect of percent identifying as Hispanic on drive times.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long drive times restrict access to audiological care for those who live in rural areas. This restriction disproportionately affects those in rural areas who identify as Hispanic or have low income.\nPMID:\n38758682\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00279",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Bone conduction hearing devices (BCDs) that deliver sound across the skin (i.e., transcutaneous) are suitable for some individuals who have conductive or mixed hearing losses. Prescriptive targets for percutaneous devices are available, for example, from the Desired Sensation Level-Bone Conduction Hearing Device (DSL-BCD) algorithm. These targets, however, may require modification for use with transcutaneous BCDs. The current study investigated three key variables that may inform target modification: (a) comparison of thresholds measured using an audiometric bone conduction (BC) transducer versus transcutaneous BCDs that offer in situ threshold measurement, (b) transcutaneous BCD default force level outputs versus recommended DSL percutaneous BC targets, and (c) the preferred listening levels (PLLs) of adults wearing transcutaneous BCDs in a laboratory setting.\nMETHOD: Bilateral conductive hearing loss was simulated in 20 normal-hearing adults via earplugs. Thresholds were measured using a B-71 BC transducer and two commercially available BCDs coupled to a soft headband. DSL percutaneous BC targets were generated, and PLLs were obtained for a 60-dB SPL speech stimulus. Force level outputs were measured using a skull simulator on the Audioscan Verifit2 at the hearing aids' default settings and at the participants' PLL for each device.\nRESULTS: On average, audiometric BC thresholds were significantly better than those measured in situ with each BCD. PLLs were similar to prescribed targets for one device with the smoother response shape and agreed in the high frequencies for both devices.\nCONCLUSIONS: In situ thresholds are significantly higher than audiometric BC thresholds, suggesting that device-based in situ measurement more accurately accounts for the signal transmission from transcutaneous BCDs. PLLs differed from the percutaneous targets and varied between devices, which may indicate that either target modifications or manipulations of device frequency response shaping are needed to approximate PLL with transcutaneous BCD devices.\nPMID:\n38748932\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00258",

Integrating interprofessional education experiences into graduate communication sciences and disorders (CSD) programs is essential to cultivate collaborative skills and prepare future professionals for the interprofessional demands of the field. Within this context, peer teaching has emerged as a noteworthy strategy to promote learning. This study aims to contribute to this evolving field by reporting the impact of an interprofessional (speech-language pathology and audiology) peer teaching educational intervention on physician assistant (PA) students' knowledge of speech-language-hearing developmental milestones and developmental screening.\nMETHOD: A quantitative, descriptive methodology with a pretest, posttest interventional design was utilized to assess the impact of a CSD peer-led educational intervention on the knowledge of 35 PA students. The perceived satisfaction of the PA students with the peer-led educational experience was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Data analysis revealed a significant increase on knowledge posttest scores compared to pretest scores. PA students also reported an overall positive peer learning experience.\nCONCLUSION: The collaboration between speech-language pathology, audiology, and PA students through peer teaching holds significant importance in the context of pediatric primary care, and for CSD graduate trainings programs interested in improving educational experiences that tailor to interprofessional learning and practice.\nPMID:\n38748920\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJA-23-00273",

These measurements allow audiologists to account for the individual's hearing and ear canal acoustics when programming hearing aids. An evidence-based hearing aid fitting includes matching the measured output of the hearing aids to targets for each input level and frequency. This allows the audiologist to confidently counsel the patient that the acoustic fitting is accurate, and the next step is for the individual to use the amplification during all waking hours to adapt to the newly amplified sounds. This also avoids mistakes such as overamplification or insufficient gain, which can endanger the patient and/or lead to a compromised fitting.\nPMID:\n38855348\n| PMC:\nPMC11161218\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0044-1786505",

The parameters of sound that may cause beneficial effects, however, are currently only theorized with limited data supporting their effectiveness. Residual inhibition is the temporary suppression or elimination of tinnitus that is usually observed following appropriate auditory stimulation. Our pilot study investigated the effects of a therapeutic acoustic stimulus that was individually customized to maximize residual inhibition of tinnitus and extend its duration to determine if there could be a sustained suppression of the tinnitus signal (i.e., reduced tinnitus loudness) and a reduction in the psychological and emotional reactions to tinnitus. This pilot study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate the feasibility of residual inhibition technique therapy through daily use of hearing aids and (2) to determine its effects by measuring reactionary changes in tinnitus with the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and perceptual changes in tinnitus loudness. A total of 20 adults (14 males, 6 females; mean age: 58 years, SD = 12.88) with chronic tinnitus were enrolled in a four-visit study that consisted of the following: (1) baseline visit and initiation of the intervention period, (2) a 1-month postintervention visit, (3) 2-month postintervention visit and initiation of a wash-out period, and (4) a 3-month visit to assess the wash-out period and any lasting effects of the intervention. The intervention consisted of fitting bilateral hearing aids and creating an individualized residual inhibition stimulus that was streamed via Bluetooth from a smartphone application to the hearing aids. The participants were instructed to wear the hearing aids and stream the residual inhibition stimulus all waking hours for the 2-month intervention period. During the wash-out period, the participants were instructed to use the hearing aids for amplification, but the residual inhibition stimulus was discontinued. At all visits, the participants completed the TFI, study-specific self-report measures to document perceptions of tinnitus, a psychoacoustic test battery consisting of tinnitus loudness and pitch matching, and a residual inhibition test battery consisting of minimum masking and minimum residual inhibition levels. At the end of the trial, participants were interviewed about the study experience and acceptability of the residual inhibition treatment technique. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted on the two main outcomes (TFI total score and tinnitus loudness) across all four visits. The results showed a significant main effect of visit on the TFI total score (\np\n< 0.0001). Specifically, the results indicated a significant reduction in TFI total scores from baseline to the 1-month post-intervention period, which remained stable across the 2-month post-intervention period and the wash-out period. The ANOVA results did not show a significant change in tinnitus loudness as a function of visit (\np\n= 0.480). The majority of the participants reported a positive experience with the study intervention at their exit interview. This pilot study demonstrated that residual inhibition as a sound therapy for tinnitus, specifically through the daily use of hearing aids, was feasible and acceptable to individuals suffering from chronic tinnitus. In addition, participants showed improvement in reactions to tinnitus as demonstrated by sustained reduction in TFI scores on average over the course of the treatment period. Achieving residual inhibition may also provide patients a feeling of control over their tinnitus, and this may have a synergistic effect in reducing the psychological and emotional distress associated with tinnitus. There was no significant reduction in long-term tinnitus loudness resulting from the residual inhibition treatment; however, the current pilot study may not have had sufficient power to detect such a change. The combination of tinnitus suppression and improved psychosocial/emotional reactions to tinnitus may result in a better quality of life in both the short and long term. A larger-scale study is needed to determine the validity of using residual inhibition as a clinical therapy option and to ascertain any effects on both perception and reactions to tinnitus.\nPMID:\n38370522\n| PMC:\nPMC10872653\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770153",

However, physical and biological constraints ensure that these signals are perceived slightly asynchronously. The brain only recognizes them as simultaneous when they occur within a period of time called the temporal binding window (TBW). Aging can prolong the TBW, leading to temporal uncertainty during multisensory integration. This effect might contribute to imbalance in the elderly but has not been examined with respect to vestibular inputs. Here, we compared the vestibular-related TBW in 13 younger and 12 older subjects undergoing 0.5 Hz sinusoidal rotations about the earth-vertical axis. An alternating dichotic auditory stimulus was presented at the same frequency but with the phase varied to determine the temporal range over which the two stimuli were perceived as simultaneous at least 75% of the time, defined as the TBW. The mean TBW among younger subjects was 286 ms (SEM ± 56 ms) and among older subjects was 560 ms (SEM ± 52 ms). TBW was related to vestibular sensitivity among younger but not older subjects, suggesting that a prolonged TBW could be a mechanism for imbalance in the elderly person independent of changes in peripheral vestibular function.\nPMID:\n38370520\n| PMC:\nPMC10872654\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770137",

We sought to understand tinnitus rehabilitation service needs and preferences among Veterans with bothersome tinnitus who use Veterans Affairs (VA) services. We conducted semistructured telephone interviews in 2019 with Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, who reported it as bothersome. Veterans were purposively sampled to represent national VA users, with and without comorbid traumatic brain injury (TBI), and who were or were not interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services. Qualitative data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Among 40 Veterans interviewed (32 men, 8 women; 50% with TBI), 72.5% endorsed being somewhat/very likely to be interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services while 27.5% were very/somewhat unlikely. Themes related to Veterans' interest in tinnitus rehabilitation services included barriers and facilitators to participation and preferences for receiving tinnitus services (e.g., individual vs. group-based; in-person vs. remote access). Our findings highlight factors that influence Veterans' reported need and preferences for, and readiness to engage in, rehabilitation services for tinnitus. Personalized or otherwise adaptable approaches to program delivery may help ensure maximal uptake among Veterans.\nPMID:\n38370519\n| PMC:\nPMC10872667\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770138",

Many speech-in-noise tests have been developed and used to varying degrees. However, multiple barriers have prevented speech-in-noise testing from being used widely in the clinic. The purpose of this article is to provide a resource to audiologists and other hearing health professionals who want to know (1) what tests are available for use, (2) the rationale behind specific tests, and (3) important considerations when selecting one or more tests to use clinically. In addition, data are presented for four speech-in-noise tests with the purpose of comparing outcomes as a function of age and hearing status. The four tests (QuickSIN, Words in Noise [WIN], Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences [LiSN-S], and Coordinate Response Measure [CRM]) were completed by 30 individuals from three groups: 10 young adults with normal hearing, 10 older adults with normal hearing, and 10 older adults with hearing loss. The results suggest that, despite significant differences in performance between groups, group overlap was present such that some individuals from one group performed similar to some individuals of other groups; therefore, individual performance was more important than associated group. When selecting an appropriate speech-in-noise test to use clinically, audiologists should carefully consider the purpose of their testing and the type of information they desire as an outcome. A quick-resource table and appendix is provided to aid audiologists and other health professionals in their selection of an appropriate speech-in-noise test.\nPMID:\n38370518\n| PMC:\nPMC10872656\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770155",

It is analogous to ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. OCT has recently been introduced in auditory research to visualize the various structures of the ear with a minimally invasive operation. In addition, OCT can be used as a vibrometry system that is capable to detect sound-induced sub-nanometer vibrations of the middle and inner ear. OCT-vibrometry measures depth-resolved vibrations into the specimen, which overcomes several limitations of classical vibrometry techniques (e.g., single surface point measurements using laser interferometry). In this article, we illustrate how to visualize the anatomy and function of the middle and inner ear (the cochlea) in a gerbil model using recently developed spectral-domain OCT. Our results demonstrate that the largest clinical impact of OCT for otology is to visualize various pathologies and quantify sound conduction and processing in the individual peripheral human ear.\nPMID:\n38370517\n| PMC:\nPMC10872649\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770154",

Severe tinnitus can be associated with negative impacts on daily life. Veterans with severe tinnitus may also have greater difficulties in functional roles, including work. However, few studies have explicitly explored this relationship. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also prevalent among Veterans, is associated with tinnitus and can additionally impair work functioning. This quantitative investigation used a population-based survey to assess the relationship between tinnitus severity, measured using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the impact of tinnitus on work, measured using a composite score from the Tinnitus History Questionnaire, among a stratified random sample of VA healthcare-using Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus, with and without comorbid TBI. Analyses were weighted to account for sampling design and Veteran non-response; multiple imputation was used to account for missing data. Results indicated that for every 1-point increase in TFI score, there was an average 8% increase in the odds of reporting a high level of impact on work functioning (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.11). Veterans with a comorbid TBI diagnosis, compared with those without, were more likely to have high tinnitus-related impact on work functioning (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.85, 3.91), but the relationship between tinnitus severity and the impact of tinnitus on work functioning did not differ by TBI status. These data can help researchers and clinicians understand complex symptoms experienced by Veterans with tinnitus, with and without TBI, supporting the improved provision of clinical services to these patients.\nPMID:\n38370516\n| PMC:\nPMC10872655\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770152",

However, the impaired sensory and/or cognitive mechanisms underlying these auditory difficulties are largely unknown. This work used a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological measures to explore how neural stimulus discrimination and processing speed contribute to impaired temporal processing in blast-exposed Veterans measured using the behavioral Gaps-in-Noise (GIN) Test. Results confirm previous findings that blast exposure can impact performance on the GIN and effect neural auditory discrimination, as measured using the P3 auditory event-related potential. Furthermore, analyses revealed correlations between GIN thresholds, P3 responses, and a measure of behavioral reaction time. Overall, this work illustrates that behavioral responses to the GIN are dependent on both auditory-specific bottom-up processing beginning with the neural activation of the cochlea and auditory brainstem as well as contributions from complex neural networks involved in processing speed and task-dependent target detection.\nPMID:\n38370515\n| PMC:\nPMC10872670\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1770139",

This study aimed to evaluate changes in attenuation over time for properly fit devices when worn by workers exposed to hazardous noise. Earplug fit testing was accomplished on 30 workers at a brewery facility with three types of foam and three types of premolded earplugs. The personal attenuation ratings (PARs) were measured before and after a 2-hour work period while exposed to hazardous noise levels. The minimum acceptable initial PAR was 15 dB. Average decreases in PAR ranged from -0.7 to -2.6 dB across all six earplug types. Significant changes in PAR were observed for the Foam-1 (\np\n= 0.009) and Premold-3 (\np\n= 0.004) earplugs. A linear mixed regression model using HPD type and study year as fixed effects and subject as random effect was not significant for either fixed effect (\nα\n= 0.05). Ninety-five percent of the final PAR measurements maintained the target attenuation of 15 dB. Properly fitting earplugs can be effective at reducing worker's noise exposures over time. The potential for a decrease in attenuation during the work shift should be considered when training workers and establishing the adequacy of protection from hazardous noise exposures.\nPMID:\n37818150\n| PMC:\nPMC10562054\n| DOI:\n10.1055/s-0043-1769586",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: Electrically evoked cortical auditory evoked potentials (ECAEPs) are central brain responses to auditory stimuli that correlate with post-operative cochlear implant (CI) hearing outcomes. They differ from electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) which are peripheral responses that can be elicited intraoperatively and may also predict CI hearing outcomes. It is not known to what degree ECAP and ECAEP responses are associated with each other. Such a correlation, if present, may allow for an earlier and more accurate prediction of post-operative hearing outcomes.\nDESIGN: This retrospective study involved 42 adult CI users. Threshold levels and amplitude growth function slopes of intraoperative ECAPs were compared to the latencies and peak-to-peak amplitudes of postoperative ECAEP responses at three different cochlear electrode array sites (apical, medial, and basal).\nRESULTS: A weak positive relationship was found between intraoperative ECAP thresholds and ECAEP N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitude (r=0.301, p=0.005). Time between ECAP and ECAEP measurements was weakly correlated with P1-N1 peak-to-peak amplitude (r=0.321, p=0.002) and ECAEP N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitude (r=0.340, p=0.001). ECAP amplitude growth function (AGF) slopes varied by electrode location (χ²=26.701, df = 2, p=0. 000002).\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intraoperative ECAP responses do not robustly predict postoperative ECAEP responses, providing caution against the use of ECAPs as a predictive tool for CI hearing outcomes.\nPMID:\n39084205\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000540576",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implantation remains challenging. There are several approaches to preserve residual hearing, but the configuration of the implant electrode array seems to play a major role. Lateral wall electrode arrays are seemingly more favorable in this context. To date, there are no experimental data available which correlate the spatial electrode position in the scala tympani with the extent of hearing preservation.\nMETHODS: Based on µCT imaging data, this study analyses the exact position of a pure- silicone electrode array inserted into the cochlea of four guinea pigs. Array position data were correlated with the extent of hearing loss after implantation, measured using auditory brainstem measurements in the frequency range of the area occupied by the electrode array area as well as apical to the array.\nRESULTS: The use of pure-silicone arrays without electrodes resulted in artifact-free, high-resolution µCT images that allowed precise determination of the arrays' positions within the scala tympani. The electrode arrays' locations ranged from peri-modiolar to an anti-modiolar. These revealed a correlation of a lower postoperative hearing loss with a higher spatial proximity to the lateral wall. This correlation was found in the low-frequency range only. A significant correlation between the interindividual differences in the diameter of the scala tympani and the postoperative hearing loss could not be observed.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the importance of the intra-cochlear electrode array's position for the preservation of residual hearing. The advantage of such an electrode array's position approximated to the lateral wall suggests, at least for this type of electrode array applied in the guinea pig, would be advantageous in the preservation of residual hearing for the apical part of the cochlea, beyond the area occupied by the electrode array.\nPMID:\n38981457\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000540266",

However, clear evidence is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine if sudden sensorineural hearing loss is associated with COVID-19 illness or its vaccine.\nMETHODS: Retrospective chart review of fifty randomly selected patients from three, 6-month time periods: \"pre-pandemic\", \"early pandemic\", and \"late pandemic\". Group comparisons were performed for demographics, comorbid conditions, audiologic history, audiometric data, speech reception thresholds, and word recognition.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were included in this study. A mean difference was observed in that the relative percentage of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) cases increased over time, corresponding to a relative decrease in conductive hearing loss cases. However, this change was not explained by proportional changes in sudden SNHL. Patients in the early pandemic time period were more likely to report tinnitus. Otherwise, the patient groups did not differ on demographic variables, hearing health history, hearing loss presentation, pure tone averages, speech reception thresholds, or word recognition performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proportion of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss did not change over time from the pre-pandemic period to the early or late pandemic phases. Despite a randomized sample, these findings do not support the hypothesis that COVID-19 illness or vaccine is associated with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38880092\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539791",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: The primary goal is to investigate the suitability of CHAPS for assessing cognitive abilities and auditory processing in people with hearing loss, specifically in the domains of auditory processing, verbal working memory, and auditory attention.\nMETHOD: The study comprised 44 individuals between the ages of seven and 14, 22 with hearing loss (N = 11 males), and 22 with normal hearing (N = 10 males). Individuals' auditory attention, working memory, and auditory processing skills were assessed in the study, and self-report questionnaires were used. The evaluation utilized the Sustained Auditory Attention Capacity Test (SAACT), Working Memory Scale (WMS), Filtered Words Test, Auditory Figured Ground Test (AFGT), and the Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS). Analyses were conducted, including group comparisons, correlation examinations, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) evaluations.\nRESULTS: There were significant differences in CHAPS total, attention, noise, quiet, and multiple inputs between groups. No significant differences were seen in CHAPS_ideal and CHAPS_auditory memory across groups. The study of SAACT and its subscores, WMS and its subscores, FWT, and AFGT revealed a significant difference between groups, caused by the poor performance of persons in the HL group compared to those in the NH group. The SAACT and its subscores correlated significantly with CHAPS_attention. The AUC calculation showed that The SAACT and CHAPS_attention distinguished persons with or without hearing loss (p&lt;0.05). WMS_stm and WMS_total correlated with CHAPS auditory memory subscale, however WMS_vwm did not. AUC values for WMS and its subscores showed significant discrimination in identifying children with or without hearing loss (p&lt;0.05), whereas CHAPS_auditory memory did not (AUC=0.665; p=0.060). FWT and AFGT had a significant relationship with CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subscales. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests only correlated with AFGT. CHAPS_quite and CHAPS_ideal did not exhibit significant discriminative values (p&lt;0.05) for identifying children with or without hearing loss, while CHAPS_noise, CHAPS_multiple inputs, FWT, and AFGT did.\nCONCLUSION: The CHAPS_attention subscale could be a trustworthy instrument for assessing auditory attention in children with hearing loss. However, the CHAPS_auditory memory subscale may not be suitable for testing working memory. While performance-based auditory processing tests showed improved discrimination, the CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subtests can still assess hearing-impaired auditory processing. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests may not evaluate auditory processing.\nPMID:\n38880084\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539570",

The preservation of auditory neuronal and sensory neural hearing cells has a positive impact on auditory perception after implantation. This study aimed to provide details on a semi-automated spiral ganglion neuronal cell counting method, developed using whole implanted gerbil cochlea acquisitions with light sheet microscopy.\nMETHODS: Mongolian gerbils underwent right cochlear implantation with an electrode array whose silicone was loaded with dexamethasone or not and were euthanized 10 weeks after implantation. The cochleae were prepared according to a 29-day protocol, with the electrode array in place. Light sheet microscopy was used for acquisition, and Imaris software was employed for three-dimensional analysis of the cochleas and semi-automatic quantification of spiral ganglion cells. The imaJ software was used for manual quantification of these cells.\nRESULTS: Six cochleae were acquired by light-sheet microscopy, allowing good identification of cells. There was no significant difference between the mean number of spiral ganglion cell obtained by manual and semi-automatic counting (p = 0,25).\nCONCLUSION: Light sheet microscopy provided complete visualization of the spiral ganglion and cell identification. The semi-automated counting method developed using Imaris software tools proved reliable and efficient and could be applied to a larger sample to assess post-cochlear implant cell damage and the efficacy of protective drugs delivered to the inner ear.\nPMID:\n38810615\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539569",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nBACKGROUND: Many studies have shown increased academic problems in children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL). However, whether hearing devices can ameliorate the educational difficulties associated with UHL is not well studied. Therefore, the objective of the current systematic review was to answer the question: Do non-surgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, and/or cochlear implants improve academic outcomes in school-aged children and adolescents with UHL?\nMETHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to 12/21/22. Published, peer-reviewed studies comparing academic outcomes in patients with UHL aged ≥ 5 and ≤ 19 years with and without hearing devices (non-surgical amplification devices, bone-anchored hearing aids, or cochlear implants) were included. Results of studies were qualitatively synthesized, and the risk of bias was evaluated with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool.\nRESULTS: A total of 5,644 non-duplicate publications were identified by the search, and four studies were included for synthesis, every one of which was investigating non-surgical amplification. One small, single-arm study demonstrated significant improvement in subjective classroom listening difficulties after a 3- to 4-month trial with a BTE hearing aid. The other three studies of non-surgical amplification devices showed no benefit across multiple academic outcomes with FM systems and conventional and CROS-style hearing aids.\nDISCUSSION: The small sample sizes, heterogeneous and/or ill-defined study samples, and overall low quality of the available literature ultimately make it hard to draw definitive conclusions regarding non-surgical amplification devices' effectiveness in improving academic outcomes in children with UHL. No articles were identified that studied cochlear implants or bone-anchored hearing aids. Further studies with high-quality study design, large sample sizes, and long-term follow-up are needed to answer this clinically important question.\nPMID:\n38810609\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539513",

The scores were assessed using the Percent Sentence Recognition Index (PSRI). The data were inferentially analysed using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests with a 95% confidence interval and 5% significance level (p &lt; 0.05).\nRESULTS: The mean age was 41.1 years, the mean duration of CI use was 11.4 years, and the mean hearing threshold was 29.7 ± 5.9 dBHL. Test performance, as determined by the PSRI, was MLV = 42.4 ± 17.9%; RSTS = 20.3 ± 14.3%; RSSS = 40.6 ± 20.7%.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Otosclerosis is a bone disorder affecting the labyrinthine capsule that leads to conductive and occasionally sensorineural hearing loss. The etiology of otosclerosis remains unknown; factors such as infection, hormones, inflammation, genetics, and autoimmunity have been discussed. Treatment consists primarily of surgical stapes replacement and cochlear implantation. High-resolution computed tomography is routinely used to visualize bone pathology. In the present study, we used synchrotron radiation phase-contrast imaging (SR-PCI) to examine otosclerosis plaques in a temporal bone for the first time. The primary aim was to study their three-dimensional (3D) outline, vascular interrelationships, and connections to the middle ear.\nMETHODS: A donated ear from a patient with otosclerosis who had undergone partial stapedectomy with the insertion of a stapes wire prosthesis was investigated using SR-PCI and compared with a control ear. Otosclerotic lesions were 3D rendered using the composite with shading technique. Scalar opacity and color mapping were adjusted to display volume properties with the removal of bones to enhance surfaces. Vascular bone channels were segmented, and the communications between lesions and the middle ear were established.\nRESULTS: Fenestral, cochlear, meatal, and vestibular lesions were outlined three-dimensionally. Vascular bone channels were found to be frequently connected to the middle ear mucosa, perilabyrinthine air spaces, and facial nerve vessels. Round window lesions partly embedded the cochlear aqueduct which was pathologically narrowed, while the inferior cochlear vein was significantly dilated in its proximal part.\nCONCLUSION: Otosclerotic/otospongiotic lesions were imaged for the first time using SR-PCI and 3D rendering. The presence of shunts and abnormal vascular connections to the labyrinth appeared to result in hyper-vascularization, overloading the venous system, and leading to sensorineural hearing loss. We speculate about possible local treatments to alleviate the impact of such critical lesions on the labyrinthine microcirculation.\nPMID:\n38763131\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539422",

The time course of the involved pathologies is still under investigation. Several studies have demonstrated an acute damage of the sensory tissue, but only few experiments investigated the degeneration of (type I) spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), representing the primary neurons in the auditory system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of SGN degeneration within a 7-day period after traumatic noise exposure starting immediately after trauma.\nMETHODS: Young adult normal hearing mice were noise exposed for 3 h with a broadband noise (5-20 kHz) at 115 dB SPL. Auditory threshold shift was measured by auditory brainstem recordings, and SGN densities were analyzed at different time points during the first week after acoustic trauma.\nRESULTS: Significant reduction of SGN densities was detected and is accompanied by a significant hearing loss. Degeneration starts within hours after the applied trauma, further progressing within days post-exposure.\nDISCUSSION: Early neurodegeneration in the auditory periphery seems to be induced by direct overstimulation of the auditory nerve fibers. SGN loss is supposed to be a result of inflammatory responses and neural deprivation, leading to permanent hearing loss and auditory processing deficits.\nPMID:\n38749408\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000539359",

Fifteen HA users who were candidates for contralateral CI completed the study (mean age 65.6 years).\nRESULTS: Patients used both devices at a median rate of 97%, 97%, and 98% of the time at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. On average, patients' hearing handicap scores decreased by 16% at 1 month, 36% at 3 months, and 30% at 6 months.

This variability may be related to brain changes associated with intact senses recruiting cortical areas from stimulation-deprived senses. Numerous studies have demonstrated such cross-modal reorganization in individuals with untreated hearing loss. How it is affected by regular use of hearing devices remains unclear, however. To shed light on this, the current study measured cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities in experienced CI users and normal-hearing controls.\nMETHODS: Using multichannel electroencephalography, we tested CI users who had used their devices for at least 12 months and closely matched controls (N = 2 × 13). Cortical responses reflecting comprehension abilities - the N400 and late positive complex (LPC) components - were evoked using congruent and incongruent digit-triplet stimuli. The participants' task was to assess digit-triplet congruency by means of timed button presses. All measurements were performed in speech-shaped noise 15 dB above individually measured speech recognition thresholds. Three stimulus presentation modes were used: auditory-only, visual-only, and visual-then-auditory.\nRESULTS: The analyses revealed no group differences in the N400 and LPC responses. In terms of response times, the CI users were slower and differentially affected by the three stimulus presentation modes relative to the controls.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to normal-hearing controls, experienced CI users may need more time to comprehend speech in noise.

A newer Fast method - Italian Fast Speech Reception Threshold 50 (IFastSRT50) - is performed by means of program software with a single list of bisyllabic words and noise intensity shifting.\nRESULTS: Means comparison between SRT50 Classic and IFastSRT50 shows a slight significant correlation (r = 0.263; p = 0.044) and a wide significant difference: SRT50 Classic = -2.763 dB (SD = 4.1) and IFastSRT50 = -7.803 dB (SD = 2.1) (p &lt; 0.0001). There is a high difference between the test execution time means (SRT50 Classic = 11 min, IFastSRT50 = 2 min; p &lt; 0.0001). The correlation between test results and execution times was higher for SRT50 Classic than IFastSRT50.\nCONCLUSION: IFastSRT50 test is a reliable method to quickly investigate signal-to-noise ratio needed to obtain 50% of recognition scores with bisyllabic words; it allows less execution time than SRT50 Classic method and can avoid patient fatigue and other limitations of different speech discrimination tests in noise as sentences based ones.\nPMID:\n38631316\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538556",

The study encompassed the assessment of the clinical presentation, treatment, quality of life, and evolution after treatment of the identified individuals.\nRESULTS: During the study period, six patients, aged between 33 and 71 years, developed vestibular ototoxicity following the use of topical aminoglycoside drops due infection flares in chronic otitis media. All cases involved the use of gentamicin. Two cases were unilateral, and four were unilateral. The onset of symptoms occurred within one to four weeks of using the drops, resulting in all patients experiencing instability without vertigo attacks. After discontinuing the drops and undergoing vestibular rehabilitation, four patients experienced sequelae, with two patients (both with bilateral vestibular hypofunction) suffering significant impairment in their quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Vestibular ototoxicity due to the topical application of aminoglycosides during acute exacerbations of chronic otitis media is a rare occurrence. However, given its potential for severe consequences and the fact that we are still encountering patients with this condition, healthcare professionals should explore alternative antibacterial agents that offer similar efficacy.\nPMID:\n38588647\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000538756",

The aim of this study was to assess whether COPD is associated with hearing loss that affects speech recognition.\nMETHODS: This is a case-control study. We screened individuals from health facilities in the municipality of Jundiai. We enrolled a test group of individuals with COPD and an age-matched control group composed of individuals with asthma. The selected individuals attended an appointment with a chest physician, responded questionnaires and underwent tonal and speech audiometry. Adjusted binary logistic regression analysis evaluated whether COPD was associated with reduced speech recognition.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 36 individuals with COPD and 72 with asthma. Individuals with COPD were more likely to have a reduced speech recognition compared to asthmatic individuals [Reduced recognition of three-syllable words: adjusted OR 3.72, 95 CI (1.38 - 10.02)] [Reduced recognition of monosyllable words: adjusted OR 4.74, 95 CI (1.52 - 14.76)].\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that individuals with COPD from primary and secondary healthcare facilities have at least 38% greater risk of hearing loss with reduced speech recognition compared to an age-matched control group of individuals with asthma recruited from the same facilities.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nINTRODUCTION: Auditory performance in noise of cochlear implant recipients can be assessed with the adaptive Matrix test (MT); however, when the speech-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds 15 dB, the background noise has any negative impact on the speech recognition. Here, we aim to evaluate the predictive power of aided pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in quiet, and establish cut-off values for both tests that indicate whether auditory performance in noise can be assessed using the Matrix sentence test in a diffuse noise environment.\nMETHODS: Here, we assessed the power of pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition in quiet to predict the response to the MT. Ninety-eight cochlear implant recipients were assessed using different sound processors from Advanced Bionics (n=56) and Cochlear (n=42). Auditory tests were performed at least 1-year after cochlear implantation or upgrading the sound processor to ensure the best benefit of the implant. Auditory assessment of the implanted ear in free-field conditions included: pure-tone average (PTA), speech discrimination score (SDS) in quiet at 65 dB, and speech recognition threshold (SRT) in noise that is the SNR at which the patient can correctly recognize 50% of the words using the MT in a diffuse sound field.\nRESULTS: The SRT in noise was determined in sixty patients (61%) and undetermined in 38 (39%) using the MT. When cut-off values for PTA <36 dB and SDS >41% were used separately, they were able to predict a positive response to the MT in 83% of recipients; using both cut-off values together, the predictive value reached 92%.\nDISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: As the pure-tone audiometry is standardized universally and the speech recognition in quiet could vary depending on the language used; we propose that the MT should be performed in recipients with PTA <36 dB, and in recipients with PTA >36 dB, a list of Matrix sentences at a fixed SNR should be presented to determine the percentage of words understood. This approach should enable clinicians to obtain information about auditory performance in noise whenever possible.\nPMID:\n38527427\n| DOI:\n10.1159/000535622",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nDysphagia is common in motor neurone disease (MND) and associated with negative health and psychosocial outcomes. Although largely considered a motor disease, a growing body of evidence suggests that MND can also affect the sensory system. As intact sensation is vital for safe swallowing, and sensory changes can influence the clinical management of dysphagia in people living with MND, this review evaluated and summarised the current evidence for sensory changes related to swallowing in MND. Of 3,481 articles originally identified, 29 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 20 studies reported sensory changes, which included laryngeal sensation, taste, gag reflex, cough reflex, tongue sensation, smell, palatal and pharyngeal sensation, silent aspiration, and undefined sensation of the swallowing mechanism. Sensory changes were either described as decreased (n = 16) or heightened (n = 4). In the remaining nine studies, sensory function was reported as unaffected. The presence of changes to sensory function related to swallowing in MND remains inconclusive, although an increasing number of studies report sensory changes in some sensory domains. Future research is needed to evaluate the prevalence of sensory changes in MND and how such changes may influence dysphagia and its management.\nPMID:\n39096334\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10742-x",

This prospective study was conducted in China with individuals who speak Mandarin. The DHI-CM was developed according to a five-stage process. 264 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and 187 healthy individuals completed the study. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's α and test-retest reliability. Differences between healthy participants and patients with OD were analyzed for instrument validity. Convergent and concurrent validity were assessed using the Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QoL) and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), respectively. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was used to assess content validity. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (EFA and CFA, respectively) were used to assess structural validity. The Cronbach's alpha was > 0.9 for the total score and every individual subscale. The Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficients were both > 0.8. The patients with OD showed significantly higher scores in the DHI-CM and its subscales than the healthy individuals. Significant correlations were found between most subscales of the DHI-CM and both the SWAL-QoL and FOIS. The CVI of the DHI-CM was 0.892 and ranged between 0.878 and 1.000 for the subscales. The EFA identified three components that explained 24.33%, 23.99%, and 22.73% of the variance, respectively. The scale showed good structural validity through CFA. Conclusions.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nFollowing the expansion of interdisciplinary communication among rehabilitative service providers, new techniques have been introduced for treating swallowing disorders. Kinesio taping (KT) is one of the recently noticed techniques in the rehabilitation of swallowing and feeding disorders. Given the novelty of this technique in research and practice, the present scoping review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the effects of KT on the oropharyngeal function related to swallowing, and to identify current knowledge gaps to guide future studies. The initial comprehensive search was conducted in the six databases in November 2022 and then was updated in June 2023. Studies were independently reviewed by two authors to exclude all types of reviews and study protocols, studies published only in an abstract form and also studies that used KT for improving voice and dysarthria symptoms. The methodology of the included studies was also critically appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) standard tools by two authors. The results of the studies were categorized and reported based on their overall objectives. In final analysis, 21 articles were described. Study designs ranged from randomized control trials (RCTs) to the case reports. The effects of KT had been investigated on drooling, oral feeding skills of infants, immediate activation of swallowing muscles, and management of dysphagia in patients with stroke or cerebral palsy (CP). Although innovative approaches to use KT as a therapeutic method in swallowing disorders have been investigated in the studies, there are many methodological limitations that affected validity of the results. In general, it seems there is not enough evidence to add KT to the usual management of feeding and swallowing disorders yet. Further studies, therefore, are required to achieve more accurate conclusions in each of the objectives summarized in this study.\nPMID:\n39096332\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10739-6",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOrally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) dissolve rapidly in contact with saliva and have been reported to facilitate oral administration of medications in swallowing difficulties. However, their clinical benefits remain unclear because no previous studies have examined whether ODTs facilitate medication adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. This study evaluated the association between ODT prescriptions and clinical benefits using high-dimensional propensity score (hd-PS) matching to adjust for confounding factors. Using a large Japanese commercial medical and dental claims database, we identified patients aged ≥ 65 years with post-stroke dysphagia between April 2014 and March 2021. To compare 1-year outcomes of medication adherence, cardiovascular events, and aspiration pneumonia between patients taking ODTs and non-ODTs, we performed hd-PS matching. We identified 11,813 patients without ODTs and 3178 patients with ODTs. After hd-PS matching, 2246 pairs were generated. Medication adherence for 1 year, based on the proportion of days covered, was not significantly different between the non-ODT and ODT groups before (0.887 vs. 0.900, P = 0.999) and after hd-PS matching (0.889 vs. 0.902, P = 0.977). The proportion of cardiovascular events (0.898 vs. 0.893, P = 0.591) and aspiration pneumonia (0.380 vs. 0.372, P = 0.558) were also not significantly different between the groups. This study found no significant differences in medication adherence, cardiovascular diseases, or aspiration pneumonia between the non-ODT and ODT groups in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. Both groups achieved a proportion of days covered exceeding 80%. Clinicians may consider prescribing ODTs or non-ODTs based on patient preferences rather than solely on post-stroke conditions.\nPMID:\n39096331\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10737-8",

This study aimed to identify predictive variables for PSD among patients with spontaneous ICH. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on adult patients with acute spontaneous ICH, confirmed by brain computed tomography, from June 2019 to June 2023. We analyzed demographic, neuroimaging, and stroke-specific characteristics and rehabilitation indicators. PSD was evaluated using nasogastric (NG) tube retention and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) levels at 4 and 12 weeks post-ICH. Statistical analyses involved univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify PSD predictors. A total of 310 ICH patients were included in the study. At 4 weeks, significant predictors for NG tube retention included 24-hour National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, estimated glomerular filtration rate and sitting balance. At 12 weeks, hospital stay duration and ICH score were significant predictors for NG tube retention. Regarding the FOIS, significant predictors at 4 weeks included higher 24-hour NIHSS scores, compromised sitting balance, immobility-related complications, initial hematoma volume and intraventricular hemorrhages. At 12 weeks, older age and higher 24-hour NIHSS scores significantly predicted lower FOIS levels. Our findings demonstrate that PSD in ICH patients is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including stroke severity, renal function, and physical impairment. The study highlights the importance of early neurological assessment, physical function, and comprehensive management in improving swallowing outcomes, emphasizing a multifaceted approach to enhancing outcomes for ICH survivors.\nPMID:\n39066832\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10735-w",

The scale measures the severity of residue in the vallecula and pyriform sinus. Ninety Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing images were selected after consensus and proposed to 13 raters who were asked to assess the severity of pharyngeal residue (PR) in each image in two moments with an interval of two weeks. The raters were divided by years of experience conducting the Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing and in experience using severity scales for residues. Construct validity, inter-rater, and intra-rater reliability were assessed by kappa statistics. The original English scale was translated into European Portuguese using a forward-backward method for validation. The scale reliability was strong, with an elevated intra-rater internal consistency for vallecula (Cronbach's alpha = 0.982) and pyriform sinus (Cronbach's alpha = 0.922). Inter-rater reliability for raters was equally significant and high for vallecula (0.613 for first assessment and 0.604 for second assessment) and pyriform sinus (0.558 for first assessment and 0.509 for second assessment) or for raters with experience using Yale Pharyngeal Severity Rating Scale (vallecula with 0.832 for first assessment and 0.717 for second assessment and pyriform sinus with 0.856 for first assessment and 0.714 for second assessment).The European Portuguese version of the Yale Pharyngeal Severity Rating Scale is a valid, reliable instrument for scoring the location and severity of pharyngeal residue in the context of fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.\nPMID:\n39060512\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10731-0",

Although it was developed using videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, it is frequently used to rate Flexible Endoscopic Evaluations of Swallowing. The validity and reliability of DOSS-use with FEES, however, has not previously been evaluated. This study investigated the validity and rater reliability of clinicians using DOSS to rate FEES. Eleven Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) with varied dysphagia experience were recruited to review and DOSS-rate 17 soundless FEES (198 bolus swallows) recorded from 11 heterogenic dysphagic patients (2 cases with repeat FEES) and 4 healthy adults. The SLPs DOSS-ratings were compared against the initial comprehensive dysphagia evaluation (including patient diagnosis, interview, cranial nerve and complete FEES assessment) with Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) and DOSS outcome measures. The SLPs were blinded to patient details and comprehensive dysphagia examination. Re-randomised rating of FEES cases occurred two weeks later (intra rater reliability). Criterion validity for DOSS-ratings (compared against comprehensive dysphagia evaluation with FOIS and DOSS) were strong-very strong (r\ns\n= 0.858 and 0.936 respectively; p < 0.001). Inter rater reliability demonstrated high agreement (α = 0.891), also intra rater reliability demonstrated almost perfect agreement (Kw = 0.945). This study's results, with strong-very strong criterion validity and high rater reliability by SLPs, adds to the evidence for DOSS-use with FEES. Future validity research comparing DOSS with both FEES and VFSS simultaneously is recommended.\nPMID:\n39046477\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10732-z",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a pureed diet with either a gelling agent or a xanthan gum-based thickener to prevent pharyngeal residues in patients with dysphagia. We retrospectively analyzed a randomized, crossover trial of pureed rice with either a gelling agent or a xanthan gum-based thickener in patients with dysphagia. The enrolled patients were classified into mild and moderate-to-severe dysphagia groups. The primary outcome measure was degree of need for cyclic ingestion using test jelly for pharyngeal residuals (cyclic ingestion score). The secondary outcome was the patient's sense of material remaining in the throat following swallowing. Sixty-two patients (58% men; mean age 83 ± 9 years) with dysphagia were included. They were classified into mild dysphagia (n = 26) and moderate-to-severe dysphagia (n = 36) groups. In the moderate-to-severe dysphagia group, pharyngeal residuals were significantly less likely with pureed diets using a gelling agent than with those using a xanthan gum-based thickener, with respective median cyclic ingestion scores (range) of 1 (0-4) vs. 2.5 (0-4) (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in pharyngeal residuals between the pureed diets in the mild dysphagia group. The multivariate analysis identified gelling agent as an important factor significantly associated with less pharyngeal residual after swallowing of pureed diet in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia. Pureed diets thickened by a gelling agent decrease pharyngeal residues in patients with moderate-to-severe dysphagia and may reduce risk of aspiration pneumonia.\nPMID:\n39017926\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10734-x",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nDysphagia is the most common serious complication after stroke, with an incidence of about 37-78%, which seriously affects the independence of patients in daily life and clinical recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), as a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, is an emerging option for post-stroke dysphagia. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a new mode of transcranial magnetic stimulation that simulates the frequency of pulses released in the hippocampus.Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to increase cortical excitability and improve swallowing function in patients. Our study sought to summarize existing clinical randomized controlled trials to provide evidence-based medical evidence for the clinical use of iTBS. A computer search was conducted on 4 Chinese (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Information Resource System, CNKI, and Wanfang Medical Science) and 4 English (including Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science) databases to retrieve all randomized controlled trials in Chinese and English that explored the effects of Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation for post-stroke dysphagia. The retrieval years are from database construction to 23 November 2023. The primary outcome measure was a change in Penetration/Aspiration Scale (PAS), Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) and Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Secondary outcomes included Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS), water-swallowing test (WST) etc. A meta-analysis by Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was performed with RevMan 5.3. we appraise risk of bias(RoB) of each study with the Cochrane RoB tool. Detailed instructions for using the Cochrane RoB tool are provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (The Cochrane Handbook). Nine studies were obtained from eight databases after screening by inclusion and exclusion criteria, 567 patients from 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and one study was included in the qualitative analysis due to different control groups. Two of the nine studies had an unclear risk of bias, and four studies were at low risk. The results showed that iTBS significantly improved SSA, PAS, FOIS, and PAS scores in stroke patients compared to the control group(P < 0.05), and promoted swallowing function recovery. Our systematic review provides the first evidence of the efficacy of iTBS in improving dysphagia in stroke patients. However, the number of available studies limits the persuasiveness of the evidence and further validation by additional randomized controlled trials is needed.\nPMID:\n39008039\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10729-8",

Each task was completed three times in a block, for a total of five blocks. Blocks were randomized and presented with set time intervals using PsychoPy. Motor activity was highest during effortful swallows, followed by normal swallows, and lingual presses. Activation in the sensory region was not significantly different across tasks; however, effortful swallows elicited the highest mean peak activation. Our findings suggest that fNIRS can be a viable imaging method used to examine differences in cortical activity in the context of swallowing.

We conducted a dynamic, ambidirectional cohort study involving 148 subjects at risk of dysphagia in a tertiary university hospital. Our aim was to determine the risk of pneumonia attributed to alterations in swallowing safety detected during FEES. We used multivariate negative binomial regression models to adjust for potential confounders. The incidence density rate (IR) of pneumonia in patients with tracheal aspiration of any consistency was 26.6/100 people-years (RR 7.25; 95% CI: 3.50-14.98; P < 0.001). The IR was 19.7/100 people-years (RR 7.85; 95% CI: 3.34-18.47; P < 0.001) in those with laryngeal penetration of any consistency and 18.1/100 people-years (RR 6.24; 95% CI: 2.58-15.09; P < 0.001) in those with pharyngeal residue of any consistency. When adjusted for aspiration, the association of residue and penetration with pneumonia disappeared, suggesting that their risk of pneumonia is dependent on the presence of aspiration and that only aspiration is independently associated with pneumonia. This increased risk of pneumonia was significant in uni- and multivariate negative binomial regression models. We found an independently increased risk of pneumonia among patients with dysphagia and aspiration detected during FEES. Alterations in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, without aspiration, did not increase the risk of pneumonia.\nPMID:\n38958706\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10727-w",

However, the psychosocial effect of an individual's dysphagia on those that care for them is less known. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinically efficient, statistically robust companion-reported outcomes measure to the Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI) to better understand the impact of a patient's dysphagia on their companions as related to physical, emotional and functional domains of health-related quality of life. Seventy-seven initial statements describing companion perceptions of dysphagia were divided into physical, emotional and functional subscales. The statements were administered to 75 consecutive companions of individuals with dysphagia. Respondents replied never, almost never, sometimes, almost always and always to each statement and rated their companion's dysphagia severity on a 7-point equal appearing interval scale. Cronbach's α was performed to assess the internal consistency validation of the statements. The final questionnaire was reduced to 25 items and administered to 317 companions of individuals with dysphagia and 31 controls. Test-retest was performed on 29 companions of individuals with dysphagia. Cronbach's α was strong for the initial and final versions at r = 0.96 and r = 0.97 respectively. Significant differences occurred between companion responses of subjects with dysphagia and the control group. Test-retest reliability was strong (all ICC > 0.85). We present a statistically robust companion-reported outcomes measure to assess the handicapping effects of dysphagia on companions to further our understanding of the global effect of dysphagia and to guide treatment for successful swallowing outcomes.\nPMID:\n38954020\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10716-z",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in pulmonary rehabilitation programs (PRPs) are not routinely screened for dysphagia. An Australian regional health service audit revealed that patients with COPD are frequently referred to speech pathology during acute admissions, rather than proactively to mitigate the risk of dysphagia-related consequences. Referral patterns to speech pathology using a novel transdisciplinary approach for identifying at risk for dysphagia patients in a PRP were explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of a transdisciplinary dysphagia screening questionnaire on speech pathology referrals within a cohort of patients with COPD enrolled in a PRP. This quasi-experimental study introduced a dysphagia screening questionnaire in a PRP using a transdisciplinary approach. A retrospective audit of PRP patients (n = 563) between 01/01/2014 and 31/12/2018 was conducted to identify the frequency of referrals to speech pathology for dysphagia. Data was compared to a cohort of patients (n = 50) enrolled in the PRP (from 01/02/21 to 30/11/21) after introduction of the questionnaire using Fisher's exact test. Less than 1% (n = 4/563) of PRP patients were referred to speech pathology prior to implementation of the questionnaire. Following the implementation, referrals to speech pathology significantly increased to 16% (8/50) (X\n2\n= 7.72, P < 0.05; odds ratio = 7.89 95% CI [1.94, 32.1]). Introducing a dysphagia screening questionnaire increased referrals to speech pathology from a PRP. This study demonstrated the potential for a transdisciplinary approach in early screening for patients at risk of dysphagia for patients with COPD. Further research is encouraged to explore patient motivation towards speech pathology input with COPD-related dysphagia and clinicians' perceived self-efficacy in using the questionnaire.\nPMID:\n38951236\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10713-2",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nAround 80% of persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) present symptoms of dysphagia. Although cognitive impairment may contribute to dysphagia, few studies have investigated the association between the PD neuropsychological profile and objective measures of swallowing dysfunction. Since the swallowing function comprises involuntary but also voluntary actions, we hypothesize that specific measures of attention and executive functions can be underlined in PD-related dysphagia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to extensively investigate the correlation and the relationship between attentive and executive functions and safety/efficiency of pharyngeal phase of swallowing in people with PD. All participants received a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and were evaluated using the Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS); the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (IT-YPRSRS), and the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS-IT). Participants also underwent a neuropsychological assessment covering global cognitive status, attention, and frontal executive functions. Correlations and associations between neuropsychological measures and swallowing components were calculated. Twenty-one participants with PD (mean age 69.38 ± 6.58 years, mean disease duration 8.38 ± 5.31 years; mean MDS-UPDRS III 43.95 ± 24.18) completed all evaluations. The most significant correlations were found between attentive functions (i.e., Stroop Time), and executive functions (i.e., Raven's Progressive Matrices, Digit Backward and Semantic Fluency), and FOIS-IT, PAS, and IT-YPRSRS sinuses and valleculae. These associations were not influenced by disease duration. These results suggest that a dysfunction to attentional processes and/or to executive functions can contribute to penetration and the presence of pharyngeal residue in participants with middle-stage PD.\nPMID:\n38951235\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10728-9",

The Dynamic Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) is an EBP tool developed in 2016 for videofluoroscopy in head and neck (H&N) oncology with clinical implementation as a goal. We sought to examine: (1) feasibility of clinical implementation of DIGEST in a national comprehensive cancer center, and (2) fidelity of DIGEST adoption in real-world practice. A retrospective implementation evaluation was conducted in accordance with the STARI framework. Electronic health record (EHR) databases were queried for all consecutive modified barium swallow (MBS) studies conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2016 to 2021. Implementation outcomes included: feasibility as measured by DIGEST reporting in EHR (as a marker of clinical use) and fidelity as measured by accuracy of DIGEST reporting relative to the decision-tree logic (penetration-aspiration scale [PAS], residue, and Safety [S] and Efficiency [E] grades). Contextual factors examined included year, setting, cancer type, MBS indication, and provider. 13,055 MBS were conducted by 29 providers in 7,842 unique patients across the lifespan in diverse oncology populations (69% M; age 1-96 years; 58% H&N cancer; 10% inpatient, 90% outpatient). DIGEST was reported in 12,137/13,088 exams over the 6-year implementation period representing 93% (95% CI: 93-94%) adoption in all exams and 99% (95% CI: 98-99%) of exams excluding the total laryngectomy population (n = 730). DIGEST reporting varied modestly by year, cancer type, and setting/provider (> 91% in all subgroups, p < 0.001). Accuracy of DIGEST reporting was high for overall DIGEST (incorrect SE profile 1.6%, 200/12,137), DIGEST-safety (incorrect PAS 0.4% 51/12,137) and DIGEST-efficiency (incorrect residue 1.2%, 148/12,137). Clinical implementation of DIGEST was feasible with high fidelity in a busy oncology practice across a large number of providers. Adoption of the tool across the lifespan in diverse cancer diagnoses may motivate validation beyond H&N oncology.\nPMID:\n38935170\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10721-2",

This study aims to determine the voice parameters that can predict the risk of dysphagia and to determine optimal cutoff values in individuals with multiple sclerosis (IwMS). Seventy-six adults participated in the study, including 39 IwMS and 37 healthy individuals (HI). The study used the Dysphagia in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire (DYMUS), Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS), and Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) and recorded voice samples using Praat programme. Voice recordings were taken pre- and post-swallowing. The voice parameters analysed are fundamental frequency (F0), standard deviation F0 (SD F0), jitter (local), shimmer (local), and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR). Roc analysis was performed to examine the diagnostic accuracy performance of the risk for dysphagia/penetration. The parameters of IwMS pre-swallowing differed significantly from those of HI on the VHI-10, DYMUS, GUSS scores, and jitter (local), shimmer (local), and HNR. IwMS but not HI exhibited significant differences in shimmer (local) and HNR between the pre- and post-swallowing measurements. In IwMS, GUSS revealed significant differences in shimmer (local) pre- and post-swallowing between the groups with and without dysphagia/penetration. In the ROC analysis results, the area under the curve (AUC) for shimmer (local) pre-swallowing was 73.1% (cutoff = 1.69); post-swallowing, it was 78.6% (cutoff = 1.57). In conclusion, IwMS can be associated with differences in shimmer (local) and HNR parameters, low quality of life-related to voice, and dysphagia/penetration risk. The AUC values for shimmer (local) in IwMS pre- and post-swallowing may help to strengthen diagnostic decisions of dysphagia risk.\nPMID:\n38872058\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10720-3",

Risk of aspiration pneumonia or even death is very high in these populations. However, screening for dysphagia risk in these patients is complicated by the fact that most of them suffer from cognitive impairments and behavioral manifestations that hinder the assessment process using the existing screening tests. The aim of this study was to validate the Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals, in patients with cognitive impairment (dementia/intellectual disability) or with severe mental illness (schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder). For this purpose, 148 institutionalized patients were evaluated by professionals responsible for their food intake. The Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals was used to assess its validity in screening for oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients with cognitive impairments and in patients with severe mental illness. Also, the Eating Assessment Tool-10 and the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire were used for convergent reliability procedures. Four comparison groups were established: patients with cognitive impairment with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia, and patients with severe mental illness with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia. Results from the Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals adequately distinguished between groups with and without dysphagia, in addition to presenting adequate levels of convergent validity and reliability. These results were obtained from other-reports (professionals responsible for patients' food intake), using a simple, quickly applied test that does not require the use of food in patients with an altered cognitive state or with severe mental illness. With this study we expand the validity of the Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Screening Test for Patients and Professionals in populations with severe cognitive deficits and mental illness in which there is a great deficiency of oropharyngeal dysphagia screening instruments.\nPMID:\n38872057\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10707-0",

Previous validation studies found a cutoff value of 3 > swallows as pathological. The aims of this study were to establish the normative values of the RSST and to examine the effect of clinical factors on RSST scores in healthy adults. A cross-sectional study of 280 adults. An equal number of females and males were recruited for each decade of life, ages 20 to 90 years. Patients reporting swallowing difficulties, history of neurologic disorders, or head and neck surgery or radiation were excluded. Data collected included RSST scores, number and type of comorbidities, number of prescribed medications, body mass index, smoking habits, and self-assessment xerostomia questionnaire. The mean RSST score for the entire cohort was 7.01 ± 2.86. Males had a higher RSST score (7.6 ± 3.04 compared to 6.47 ± 2.56, p = 0.001). Age showed an inverse correlation with RSST scores (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = -0.463, p < 0.0001), as well as body mass index, BMI (PCC = -0.2, p < 0.0001), number of co-morbidities (PCC=-0.344, p < 0.0001) and number of prescribed medications (PCC= -0.425, p < 0.0001).

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThe assessment of pharyngeal residues during fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is based on visual-perceptual scales that involve clinical subjectivity. Training might be helpful to increase agreement among clinicians. This paper aims to assess the efficacy of training for the assessment of pharyngeal residue in FEES frames and videos through the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPRSRS). Twenty-nine clinicians (Phoniatricians, Otorhinolaryngologists, Speech and Language Pathologists) and 47 students in Speech and Language Pathology participated in this study. Fourteen clinicians were randomly allocated to the training group, whilst the remaining 15 served as a control group; all the students participated in the training. Participants scored 30 pairs of videos and frames using the YPRSRS twice, before and after the training for the training groups and at least two weeks apart for the control group. Construct validity, defined as the agreement between each rater and the experts' scores, and inter-rater reliability were compared among the groups and between the first and the second assessments to verify the efficacy of the training. Construct validity significantly improved at the second assessment in the training group for the pyriform sinuses videos (baseline 0.71 ± 0.04, post-training 0.82 ± 0.05, p = .049) and in the students' group for the valleculae (baseline 0.64 ± 0.02, post-training 0.84 ± 0.02, p < .001) and pyriform sinuses videos (baseline 0.55 ± 0.03, post-training 0.77 ± 0.02, p < .05). No significant differences were found in the inter-rater reliability in any group. In conclusion, the training seems to improve participants' agreement with experts in scoring the YPRSRS in FEES videos.\nPMID:\n38847840\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10725-y",

The primary objectives of the present study were to explore patients' narrative reports focused on what information and evaluation and treatment experiences they identified as they manage dysphagia, and to identify practice patterns relevant to dysphagia management. A secondary objective was to produce an educational resource for this population that addressed their questions about dysphagia. A sample of individuals with oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to PD (n = 25) across all regions of the United States were interviewed using open- and closed questions and a written questionnaire. Verbatim interview transcripts were interrogated using qualitative content analysis (QCA) with an inductive approach to identify themes from the participants' reported knowledge of dysphagia and experiences with swallowing evaluation and treatment. Authors developed a pamphlet addressing common questions that participants posed in the interviews and conducted a member check to revise it with their feedback. Most participants reported having been asked about their swallowing function by a healthcare professional. 60% of the sample reported having had a swallowing evaluation. Only 20% (5/25) of participants reported having completed swallowing therapy. Some participants did not know that swallowing therapy exists. Nearly all participants reported having a strong desire to know more about dysphagia and preferred a pamphlet as a resource format. Few of the study participants had received swallowing therapy, and nearly all participants were eager to learn about the nature of dysphagia, its progression, and treatment options. Given the physical, emotional, and social ramifications of living with dysphagia, access to swallowing education and treatment needs to be a stronger focus of PD management.\nPMID:\n38839626\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10723-0",

A more nuanced understanding of the psychosocial experiences of this population may assist clinicians in providing a patient-centered approach to care. Our study was designed to gather insight into the common psychosocial experiences associated with dysphagia in the context of PD. A semi-structured interview consisting of open- and closed items was conducted with 25 individuals from regions across the country with self-reported oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to PD. Questions were developed using comprehensive stress and coping frameworks that emphasized psychosocial predictors of specific affective reactions (e.g., grief, anxiety, depression), including self-evaluation (e.g., self-identity), coping strategies, social support, personal expectations (including perceived control over symptoms and prognosis), positive experiences, and perceptions of personal growth. Interview responses were subjected to a qualitative analysis and revealed three dominant themes: (1) Recalibration of a PD Diagnosis, (2) Vigilant Caution to Swallowing, and (3) Grieving the Loss of the Communal Meal. Using these data interpretations, we discuss three concepts for speech-language pathologists working with individuals with dysphagia and PD to consider during clinical interactions; these are reframing swallowing vigilance to engagement with mindful eating, using biofeedback to align patient perceptions and swallow physiology, and understanding the consequences of loss (of their former swallowing ability) through grief and growth reactions.\nPMID:\n38839625\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10722-1",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nAlthough the emergency department (ED) is the initial care setting for the majority of older adults requiring hospital admission, there is a paucity of ED-based dysphagia research in this at-risk population. This is driven by barriers to dysphagia evaluation in this complex care environment. Therefore, we assessed the reliability of trained, non-clinical ED research staff in administering dysphagia screening tools compared to trained speech pathologists (SLPs). We also aimed to determine perceptual screening discrepancies (e.g. voice change) between clinical and non-clinical staff. Forty-two older adults with suspected pneumonia were recruited during an ED visit and underwent dysphagia (Toronto Bedside Swallow Screening Tool; TOR-BSST©) and aspiration (3-oz water swallow test; 3-oz WST) screening by trained non-clinical research staff. Audio-recordings of screenings were re-rated post-hoc by trained, blinded SLPs with discrepancies resolved via consensus. Cohen's kappa (unweighted) revealed moderate agreement in pass/fail ratings between clinical and non-clinical staff for both the TOR-BSST© (k = 0.75) and the 3 oz WST (k = 0.66) corresponding to excellent sensitivity and good specificity for both the TOR-BSST (SN = 94%, SP = 85%) and the 3 oz WST (SN = 90%, SP = 81%). Further analysis of TOR-BSST perceptual parameters revealed that most discrepancies between clinicians and non-clinicians resulted from over-diagnosis of change in vocal quality (53%). These results support the feasibility of non-clinical research staff administering screening tools for dysphagia and aspiration in the ED. Dysphagia screening may not necessitate clinical staff involvement, which may improve feasibility of large-scale ED research. Future training of research staff should focus on perceptual assessment of vocal quality.\nPMID:\n38816522\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10710-5",

The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC strategy (participants, concept, and context), as follows: population (adults and older adults), concept (ultrasound assessment), and context (swallowing assessment). The review included observational, experimental, descriptive, and analytical studies and excluded those that were not available in full, animal studies, in vitro studies, letters to the editor, errata, study protocols, and those that used ultrasound for purposes other than swallowing. There were no language and time restrictions. Two independent blinded professionals selected 81 articles that met the inclusion criteria from different databases. The most evaluated parameters included tongue morphology and movements, hyoid bone displacement, swallowing muscle area, and pharyngeal residue detection, such as pharyngeal wall mobility. They used convex and linear transducers (3 MHz to 8 MHz) positioned in the submental, laryngeal, and lateral regions of the neck. The subjects were seated and instructed to eat different food volumes and consistencies. The literature mapping showed that ultrasound is a promising diagnostic tool, helping clinicians understand swallowing disorders, as it provides static and dynamic images in different modes and positions.

The submental suprahyoid muscles are often investigated with ultrasound because of their contributions to hyolaryngeal elevation. There are several techniques for positioning the ultrasound transducer in the coronal plane, however, there is limited research on how reliability of measurement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the geniohyoid differs across transducer placement technique. This study examined three methods of transducer placement in the coronal plane by two examiners to determine the reliability of measurement of CSA of the geniohyoid muscle. Forty healthy adults participated in the study. Each participant's geniohyoid muscles were imaged using B-mode ultrasound under three transducer placement conditions in the coronal plane by two examiners. Geniohyoid CSA was measured from each ultrasound image. A three-way mixed-methods ANOVA was used to determine whether there were significant differences in geniohyoid CSA among transducer position conditions, trials, and examiners. There were significant differences among the transducer placement conditions, indicating that each condition was measuring a different portion of the muscle. There were no significant differences among repeated trials nor between examiners within each method of transducer placement. All three conditions of transducer placement were reliable at measuring geniohyoid CSA across trials and examiners. This study emphasizes the need for consistency of placement, whichever method is selected. It also highlights the need for researchers to provide a precise description of methods for positioning the transducer so that placement is reproducible.\nPMID:\n38789680\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10712-3",

Dysphagia has been identified as a risk and predictive factor for the severest form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between swallowing disorders and COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\nMETHODS: We collected demographic data, medical information specific to dysphagia and data on medical treatments of patients with COVID-19.\nRESULTS: A total of 43 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty (46%) were evaluated positive for dysphagia and 23 (54%) were evaluated negative. Neurocognitive disorders and diabetes were mostly associated with patients who resulted positive for dysphagia. Respiratory impairment caused by COVID-19 seems to be a cause of dysphagia, since all patients who needed oxygen-therapy developed symptoms of dysphagia, unlike patients who did not. In the dysphagic group, alteration of the swallowing trigger resulted in the severest form of dysphagia. An association was found between the severest form of COVID-19 and dysphagia. This group consisted predominantly of males with longer hospitalization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Identification of COVID-19 patients at risk for dysphagia is crucial for better patient management.\nPMID:\n38782803\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10715-0",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nThickening agents effectively prevent liquid aspiration, but their impact on the ease of discharging aspirated liquids from the trachea remains unclear due to alterations in the physical properties of liquids. This study clarifies the effects of thickening agents, comprising various raw materials, on mucociliary transport function, focusing on the viscosities of thickened waters. The subjects were 23 healthy adults. Five types of saccharin solution were prepared: a solution without a thickening agent, a starch-based nectar-like solution, a starch-based honey-like solution, a xanthan-gum-based nectar-like solution, and a xanthan-gum-based honey-like solution. Using these five types of saccharin solutions randomly, each subject underwent five trials of the saccharine dye test to evaluate the mucociliary transport function of the respiratory tract. The saccharin time was defined as the time from the placement of the saccharin solution on the nasal vestibule of the subject to when the subject reported that they became aware of the sweetness. The saccharin transit times for all samples of thickened water were longer compared to those of water without a thickening agent (p < 0.01). A comparison between thickened water samples with different viscosities showed that the saccharin transit time was longer when thickened water samples with high viscosity were prepared using the same thickening agent (p < 0.01). This suggests that while thickening reduces aspiration, the use of thickening agents may increase the difficulty in discharging aspirated fluids from the trachea.\nPMID:\n38777870\n| DOI:\n10.1007/s00455-024-10704-3",

Although poststroke depression (PSD) and poststroke dysphagia are known to occur concurrently, there is a paucity of research that has specifically investigated their association. Therefore, we aimed to study the relationship between PSD and poststroke dysphagia during acute inpatient hospitalization and within 90 days after discharge. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the odds and hazard of being diagnosed with depression after stroke and estimate the time to depression diagnosis from the initial stroke diagnosis in patients with and without a diagnosis of dysphagia.\nMETHOD: Using the acute inpatient hospital data set from our previous work, we pulled additional postdischarge administrative claims data from the 2017 Medicare 5% Limited Data Set and conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of patients diagnosed with poststroke dysphagia and PSD.\nRESULTS: Patients diagnosed with poststroke dysphagia had 2.7 higher odds of being diagnosed with PSD and had an approximately 1.75-fold higher hazard for PSD diagnosis in the 90 days after discharge compared to patients not diagnosed with dysphagia. Risk factors for PSD included having dysphagia, being female, and having dual eligibility.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated a significant association between PSD and poststroke dysphagia. Additional research should further explore the impact of PSD on poststroke dysphagia.\nPMID:\n39088240\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00264",

Measures included questions related to demographic and injury characteristics, executive functioning, social relations, health-related quality of life, and fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints.\nRESULTS: Fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints were persistent and ultimately increased at 16 months postinjury. Over half of the participants were experiencing each symptom at 16 months postinjury (i.e., 52.94% fatigue and fogginess, 58.82% sleep complaints). At 16 months postinjury, fatigue was significantly associated with female sex, and fatigue and sleep complaints were significantly associated with lower physical quality of life, but no other differences were found with symptoms and current functioning.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support that fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints can persist (from baseline, from postinjury, and in fluctuation) chronically for about half of the children with TBI but little association or impact on other domains of functioning. The present study supports the continued investigation of fatigue, fogginess, and sleep complaints after childhood brain injury, but further investigation with a larger sample size is necessary to inform clinical practices for assessment and management, particularly for speech-language pathologists in rehabilitation and educational settings.\nPMID:\n39083509\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-24-00108",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Measuring real-world communication participation of individuals with aphasia is complicated. Historically, this has been estimated through subjective participant or proxy self-report. To address potential inaccuracies, objective measures such as \"talk time\" have been proposed. Although promising, technological barriers to collecting and quantifying everyday conversations have been documented (e.g., background noise interference, differentiating recorded speakers, and operating Bluetooth applications). This study explored the use of a novel laryngeal sensor and a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker with the objective of measuring mean talk time per hour and participant locations across three 8-hr days.\nMETHOD: Sixteen participants utilized a wearable laryngeal sensor that captures physiological mechano-acoustic signals wirelessly, without recording speech content. The sensor differentiates speech from other laryngeal movements associated with swallowing and coughing. A GPS tracker was also issued to track daily locations. Semistructured interviews regarding feasibility and acceptability were conducted with participants at the end of the data collection period.\nRESULTS: Across all participants, laryngeal sensor data were collected for a total of 38 days and GPS data for a total of 43 days, with a mean collection period of 8.21 hr (\nSD\n= 1.38) per day. Mean talk time per hour was 56.46 s (\nSD\n= 35.27). Participants were tracked at a mean of 2.09 locations daily (range: 1-6). Participants reported the devices were relatively comfortable to wear and easy to use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings indicated that talk time of individuals with aphasia is limited, though variable. Higher fluency ratings were related to greater mean talk time per hour and locations tracked. Results suggest wearable technology is feasible to use and acceptable to people with aphasia. In the future, wearable devices may offer innovative ways to measure communication participation.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26237531.\nPMID:\n39073093\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00373",

Here, we generated a modern, full-color set of 310 illustrations representing a carefully designed, culturally sensitive list of imageable nouns. We normed the images in a diverse sample of healthy adults, so the images can be used in various populations, including older adults.\nMETHOD: We recruited a diverse online sample of 200 adults ages 19-76 years. Participants typed a name for each picture and reported how familiar they were with the item (familiarity) and how well the illustration matched their mental image of the item (image agreement). We assessed relationships among these three measures, between these measures and word features (e.g., frequency, length), and between these measures and demographic characteristics of our sample.\nRESULTS: Two hundred ninety-seven of 310 items had 70% or higher name agreement among participants. Most items had good to excellent image agreement and familiarity. The image measures showed expected relationships with relevant word features (e.g., frequency, length). Older age was associated with higher image agreement and familiarity but not written naming accuracy. As a group, Black participants demonstrated lower written naming accuracy than White and mixed race participants.

This study aims to evaluate perspectives of health care providers and nonspeaking patients on effective communication and communication barriers in the ICU.\nMETHOD: Qualitative and quantitative survey methodologies were employed to evaluate providers' and patients' perspectives on effective communication. Rating scales were utilized to measure patients' frustration levels and communication effectiveness. Open-ended questions were employed to reflect on barriers to communication in the ICU, instances of ineffective communication, and recommendations for enhancing effective communication.\nRESULTS: The results of the study suggest that nonspeaking patients experienced high levels of frustration due to ineffective communication. However, the data reveal that access to appropriate augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies and materials could help mitigate patients' frustration. Providers mainly communicated via asking yes/no questions, which largely limited the information patients conveyed, leading to frequent communication breakdowns. Providers expressed a desire to participate in training programs to utilize appropriate AAC strategies and promote effective communication.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary survey results on perspectives of patients and providers on effective communication in the ICU. Both providers and patients reported experiencing challenges and frustration during their communication, due to barriers such as providers' insufficient training experience and lack of access to AAC materials.

Each child completed routine speech production and vocabulary assessments, as well as experimental speech perception and word learning tasks. The results from these tasks were then used to create profiles of each child's individual strengths and needs across the abilities assessed.\nRESULTS: Although all four children presented with phonological impairment and lexically precocious receptive and expressive vocabulary, they differed in their specific speech errors. One child presented with phonological speech errors only, while the other three children presented with an interdental lisp alongside their phonological errors. Three children presented with average speech perception abilities, and one child presented with poorer speech perception. The same three children also showed some learning of novel nonwords 1 week post-initial exposure, while the other child showed no evidence of word learning 1 week post-initial exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical profiles of lexically precocious children with phonological impairment offered different insights into the nature of the problem. Although one child appeared to present with underspecified underlying representations of words, the other three children appeared to present with well-specified underlying representations. Of the three children with well-specified underlying representations, two appeared to have difficulty abstracting particular rules of the ambient phonological system. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the underlying nature of phonological impairment.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26307640.\nPMID:\n39028570\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00370",

However, test items confound linguistic factors that make sentences difficult for PWA. The current study systematically manipulated semantic plausibility and word order in sentences like those in SC to examine how these factors affect comprehension deficits in aphasia.\nMETHOD: Fifty Korean speakers (25 PWA and 25 controls) completed a sentence-picture matching task that manipulated word order (canonical vs. noncanonical) and semantic plausibility (plausible vs. less plausible). Analyses focused on accuracy and aimed to identify sentence types that best discriminate the groups. Additionally, we explored which sentence type serves as the best predictor of aphasia severity.\nRESULTS: PWA demonstrated greater difficulties in processing less plausible sentences than plausible ones compared to the controls. Across the groups, noncanonical and less plausible sentences elicited lower accuracy than canonical and plausible sentences. Notably, the accuracy of PWA and control groups differed in noncanonical and less plausible sentences. Additionally, aphasia severity significantly correlated with less plausible sentences.\nCONCLUSION: Even in languages with flexible word order, PWA find it challenging to process sentences with noncanonical syntactic structures and less plausible semantic roles.\nPMID:\n38991166\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00353",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Milton's theory of double empathy posits that the difference in communication styles between people of different neurotypes contributes to mutual misunderstandings. The current quasi-experimental study seeks to expand on research indicating that matched neurotype pairs tend to communicate more effectively than mixed neurotype pairs by examining communication across and within neurotypes in an expository language context.\nMETHOD: Thirty autistic adults and 28 nonautistic adults were paired in either a matched neurotype or mixed neurotype condition. The pairs' interactions involved giving and listening to directions to draw an image. Interactions were recorded, transcribed, and coded for communication accuracy, rate, and clarity. Participants also completed a survey about the rapport they experienced in the interaction.\nRESULTS: Matched neurotype pairs were significantly more accurate in their communication than mixed neurotype pairs. Rate was fastest among mixed neurotype pairs, but clarity did not differ significantly across conditions. Matched autistic pairs reported significantly lower rapport than other pairs.\nCONCLUSIONS: This finding lends further support to the neurodiversity model by demonstrating that autistic communication is not inherently deficient. Further research is necessary to investigate a variety of influences on rate, clarity, and rapport development. Clinical implications include considerations for neurodiversity-affirming communication supports for expository contexts such as classroom directions or workplace instructions.\nPMID:\n38991165\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00393",

Parent-child free-play recordings were used to quantify the (para)linguistic features of the children's speech. Executive function was measured via parent report.\nRESULTS: The preterm-born group obtained significantly lower scores than the term-born group on all Bayley language measures (though differences were not consistently observed when using cutoff scores). Few preterm-term differences in LSA measures were found. The preterm-term differences in Bayley scores were not explained by between-group differences in executive function. Some preterm-term differences in LSA scores were moderated by the language sampling context. The preterm- and term-born groups exhibited different patterns of Bayley-LSA correlations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preterm language difficulties were more apparent on standardized test than LSA scores. Nonetheless, the Bayley-LSA correlations indicate that poor test performance (linked with preterm birth) is associated with functional communication difficulties. The discussion outlines the complementary utility of standardized tests and LSA while acknowledging the limited utility of cutoff scores and the confounding influence of the language sampling context.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26142661.\nPMID:\n38980152\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00318",

Reports of common co-occurrence suggest these neurodevelopmental disruptions might also be linked. Most of the data available on the issue have been based on case-control studies vulnerable to ascertainment and other biases.\nMETHOD: Seventy-eight children, representing four neurodevelopmental profiles (DLD, ADHD, co-occurring ADHD + DLD, and neurotypical development), were administered a battery of psycholinguistic tests. Parents provided standardized ratings of the severity of their children's inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and executive function symptoms. Examiners were blinded to children's clinical status. Group differences, correlations, and best subset regression analyses were used to examine potential impacts of children's ADHD symptoms on their psycholinguistic abilities.\nRESULTS: For children with DLD, significant links between their ADHD symptoms and psycholinguistic abilities were limited to the contributions of elevated hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms to lower pragmatic abilities. For children without DLD, inattention symptoms contributed to lower levels of performance in pragmatic, sentence recall, receptive vocabulary, and narrative abilities.\nDISCUSSION: Links among children's ADHD symptoms and their psycholinguistic abilities were different for children with and without DLD.

Seven studies met the search criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. For each participant, individual accuracy scores for the comprehension of personal and reflexive pronouns were extracted in addition to information on the study methods. Individual accuracy data were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and the binomial test. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis had three main findings: (a) The majority of the persons with agrammatic aphasia (89%) had no dissociation between the comprehension of personal and reflexive pronouns; (b) 8% revealed a pattern consistent with a neuropsychological dissociation, faring worse on the comprehension of personal than reflexive pronouns; and (c) 2% performed worse on reflexive than personal pronouns. The type of the task used affected pronoun comprehension accuracy and accounted for the heterogeneity in the patterns of pronoun comprehension attested across the different participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the meta-analysis did not support a dissociation between personal and reflexive pronoun comprehension in agrammatic comprehension. When confirmed, the dissociation was driven by task effects. The clinical implications of these findings were discussed together with implications to minimize the risk of bias in future examinations of the topic.\nPMID:\n38968276\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00343",

The primary purpose of this preliminary study was to examine the within-word silent interval associated with the stop closure in word-final stop consonants produced by children with and without neurodevelopmental disorders.\nMETHOD: Seven children diagnosed with either cerebral palsy or Down syndrome (i.e., children with neurodevelopmental disorders) and eight typically developing children produced a reading passage. Participants were between the ages of 11 and 16 years. Fifty-eight words from the reading passage were identified as having word-final stop consonants. The closure duration of the word-final stop consonant was calculated, both in absolute duration and percent pause time. The articulation rate of the entire passage was calculated. The number of closure durations that met or exceeded the minimum duration threshold to be considered a pause (150 ms) was examined descriptively.\nRESULTS: Children with neurodevelopmental disorders produced significantly longer closure durations and significantly slower articulation rates than typically developing children. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders produced closure durations that met or exceeded the minimum duration threshold of a pause, but typically developing children, generally, did not.\nCONCLUSION: These data indicate the need to examine the location of silent intervals that meet the minimum duration threshold of a pause and correct for articulatory events during the measurement of articulation rate and pauses in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.\nPMID:\n38963752\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00183",

Ableism manifests for people with aphasia as stigma and discrimination based on their language ability. We assert that ableism contributes to decreased quality of life for people with aphasia and should be actively challenged and disrupted by clinicians and researchers in the field.\nMETHOD: We applied the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework (HSDF) to outline how stigma and discrimination are perpetuated against people with aphasia on the basis of language ability and their downstream health and social consequences. We presented this framework at the Clinical Aphasiology Conference in 2023 and share themes and challenges that arose from this discussion and from our ongoing learning.\nDISCUSSION: Applying the HSDF to aphasia outlined potential sequelae of ableism. We identified preliminary foci of future initiatives aimed at challenging ableist beliefs and practices and means to monitor the effectiveness of such interventions. Furthermore, we draw attention to the seeming tension between anti-ableist practices and traditional language rehabilitation goals. We assert that this tension may be a catalyst for fruitful discourse on how clinicians and researchers can resist ableism while honoring the lived experiences of people with aphasia and their goals for language rehabilitation. These discussions may be facilitated by existing models in disability studies (e.g., the political/relational model).\nCONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and researchers are well positioned to challenge ableism and minimize the resultant health and social impacts for people living with aphasia. Anti-ableist practices are not antithetical to aphasia rehabilitation and can be thoughtfully integrated into rehabilitation practices and discourse.\nPMID:\n38901004\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00456",

Assessment framework was used to evaluate measures that are typically used when assessing people living with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).\nMETHOD: Forty-five assessment tools were evaluated through the lens of the five R.A.I.S.E. principles: building the client-clinician\nR\nelationship,\nA\nssessment choices,\nI\nncluding the client and care partners, providing\nS\nupport, and\nE\nvolving procedures to match client capability and progression. The principles were operationalized as questions for raters to evaluate whether a measure met this aspect of the R.A.I.S.E. Assessment framework.\nRESULTS: Ten measures commonly used in the assessment of people living with PPA met all R.A.I.S.E. principles. These measures centered upon the elicitation of naturalistic discourse, conversation, client self-report, and clinician ratings. Thirteen measures did not meet any of the criteria, and represented standardized evaluation procedures do not provide the opportunity to connect to the client, elicit or provide feedback or support, nor to adapt in response to need or performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Whether using standardized or informal assessment tools, a relational and qualitative approach to providing assessment is paramount to promote client success and therapeutic engagement.

However, a significant challenge in our field is the lack of accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of this research. Such insufficiencies limit the generalizability and impact of study findings, particularly intervention research, as it becomes difficult to replicate and use the interventions in both clinical practice and research. In this tutorial, we highlight one particularly useful tool, the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR; Hoffmann et al., 2014) checklist, which researchers can follow to improve reproducibility practices in SLHS.\nCONCLUSIONS: We provide an overview and guide on using the TIDieR checklist with a practical example of its implementation. Additionally, we discuss the potential benefits of increased transparency and reproducibility for SLHS, including improved clinical outcomes and increased confidence in the effectiveness of interventions.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Prior studies have shown that bilingual children who do not stutter (CWNS) exhibit a high number of disfluencies in both languages, increasing the risk of misidentification by speech-language pathologists as children who stutter (CWS). Conversely, there is a risk of misidentifying CWS with a relatively low incidence of disfluencies as CWNS. This study aims to explore the qualitative and quantitative distinctions in speech disfluency profiles between CWNS and CWS. The assessment covers both the dominant and nondominant language to examine the impact of language dominance on disfluency patterns.\nMETHOD: A total of 92 Lebanese bilinguals (70 CWNS and 22 CWS) from 4;06 to 7;06 (years;months) were included. Language dominance was determined based on parental assessments. Spontaneous and narrative speech samples were collected for each child in both languages and all stuttering-like disfluencies (SLD) and other disfluencies (OD) were coded.\nRESULTS: On average, CWNS showed a significantly lower percentage of total SLD, weighted SLD, SLD subtypes, and iterations compared to CWS. However, the number of disfluencies of CWNS exceeded monolingual clinical standards. Language dominance did not impact SLD and OD percentages, but some differences for SLD subtypes emerged. Binary logistic regression analyses showed that repetitions and dysrhythmic phonations are good predictors for correct CWS or CWNS classification, in contrast to OD. A combination of predictors from both languages led to better classification than using predictors from either language alone.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that speech disfluency percentages in bilingual CWNS typically surpass monolingual standards and can be at par with those of CWS. However, through careful consideration of disfluency characteristics, ideally in both languages, an accurate differential diagnosis of stuttering in bilingual children can be achieved.\nPMID:\n38889203\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00311",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can enhance aphasia recovery. Most studies have used inhibitory stimulation targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus. However, the motor cortex, observed to contribute to the prediction of aphasia recovery, is involved in word production and could be an appropriate target for rTMS. We aimed to observe behavioral changes in a picture naming task induced by inhibitory rTMS targeting the right motor cortex of the lips in people with poststroke aphasia.\nMETHOD: Using a single-case experimental design, we included three participants with chronic poststroke aphasia who had phonological deficits. Each participant performed a verbal picture naming task 3 times a week for 2, 3, or 4 weeks (pseudorandom across participants) to establish a baseline naming ability for each participant. These were not therapy sessions, and no feedback was provided. Then, each participant received the intervention, inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation targeting the right motor cortex of the lips, 3 times a week for 2 weeks. Naming testing continued 3 times a week, for these latter 2 weeks. No therapy was performed at any time during the study.\nRESULTS: Visual analysis of the graphs showed a positive effect of rTMS for P2 and P3 on picture naming accuracy and a tendency toward improvement for P1. Statistical analysis showed an improvement after rTMS for P1 (τ = 0.544,\np = .\n013,\nSE\nTau\n= 0.288) and P2 (τ = 0.708,\np = .\n001,\nSE\nTau\n= 0.235). For P3, even if the intervention allowed some improvement, this was statistically nonsignificant due to a learning effect during the baseline naming testing, which lasted the longest, 4 weeks. Regarding specific language features, phonological errors significantly decreased in all patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The motor cortex of the lips could be an appropriate target for rTMS to improve naming in people with poststroke aphasia suffering from a phonological deficit. This suggests the possibility to individualize the target for rTMS, according to the patient's linguistic impairment.\nPMID:\n38875479\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00215",

Additionally, none have manipulated dose frequency or reported on the use of music as a medium through which language and sign can be learned.\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to (a) examine the feasibility and acceptability of an online language through music intervention for young children (1-3;6 years) with Down syndrome and (b) compare effectiveness at two intervention dose frequencies.\nMETHOD: The study was carried out in two phases using a mixed-methods design.\nPhase 1:\nQualitative data were gathered from parents to examine feasibility when implementing a video-based language intervention.\nPhase 2:\nSeventy-six families participated in an online language intervention at home. Effectiveness was examined comparing two groups, randomly assigned to a high and low dose frequency. The Down Syndrome Education (DSE) checklists (combined) were the primary outcome measure. Process data were gathered to determine intervention acceptability in practice and to identify factors that would improve successful future implementation. Acceptability data were analyzed with reference to the theoretical framework of acceptability (Version 2).\nRESULTS: Forty-three parents completed the Phase 1 scoping questionnaire, five of whom took part in focus groups. Once weekly morning sessions were indicated as the preferred scheduling choice. Phase 2 quantitative data were analyzed using beta regression adjusted for baseline scores and indicated no additional benefit to receiving the higher dose. However, exploratory interaction models suggested that the efficacy of the high-dose intervention was higher (than low-dose intervention) in participants with higher baseline DSE performance. Parents perceived the intervention to be effective and positive for the family.\nCONCLUSION: The results add to our knowledge of real-world effective online interventions and suggest that a critical minimum language level is required for children with Down syndrome to benefit optimally from a higher intervention dose frequency.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25979704.\nPMID:\n38861452\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00375",

By describing their clinical profiles, we identify common barriers to functional communication in this population and provide recommendations for how speech-language pathologists (SLPs) might contribute to minimizing them.\nMETHOD: Four patients with bvFTD were selected from a cohort of patients with progressive communication impairments. Three of them returned for at least one follow-up visit. Case histories are presented along with the results of comprehensive speech and language, neuropsychological, and neurological testing.\nRESULTS: At the time of initial evaluation, patients were between the ages of 54 and 66 years and had been experiencing symptoms for 1.5-6 years. Consistent with their bvFTD diagnoses, all patients had prominent behavioral and personality changes that impacted communication. Patients 1 and 2 also had mild aphasia at enrollment, primarily characterized by anomia and loss of word meaning. Patients 3 and 4 both had apraxia of speech and moderate-to-severe aphasia at enrollment with prominent anomia and agrammatism. All four patients had impaired executive functioning and relative sparing of visuospatial skills; episodic memory was also impaired for Patients 2 and 4. Even though functional communication was progressively limited for all patients, none of them received regular support from an SLP.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case series adds to a scant, but growing, literature demonstrating that patients with bvFTD have communication impairments. SLPs are uniquely positioned to identify barriers to functional communication and to provide tailored strategy training to the patients and their care partners over the course of their disease. Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of treatment in this population would be valuable.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25933762.\nPMID:\n38843453\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-24-00013",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Prior work has identified weaknesses in commonly used indices of lexical diversity in spoken language samples, such as type-token ratio (TTR) due to sample size and elicitation variation, we explored whether TTR and other diversity measures, such as number of different words/100 (NDW), vocabulary diversity (VocD), and the moving average TTR would be more sensitive to child age and clinical status (typically developing [TD] or developmental language disorder [DLD]) if samples were obtained from standardized prompts.\nMETHOD: We utilized archival data from the norming samples of the Test of Narrative Language and the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument. We examined lexical diversity and other linguistic properties of the samples, from a total of 1,048 children, ages 4-11 years; 798 of these were considered TD, whereas 250 were categorized as having a language learning disorder.\nRESULTS: TTR was the least sensitive to child age or diagnostic group, with good potential to misidentify children with DLD as TD and TD children as having DLD. Growth slopes of NDW were shallow and not very sensitive to diagnostic grouping. The strongest performing measure was VocD. Mean length of utterance, TNW, and verbs/utterance did show both good growth trajectories and ability to distinguish between clinical and typical samples.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study, the largest and best controlled to date, re-affirms that TTR should not be used in clinical decision making with children. A second popular measure, NDW, is not measurably stronger in terms of its psychometric properties. Because the most sensitive measure of lexical diversity, VocD, is unlikely to gain popularity because of reliance on computer-assisted analysis, we suggest alternatives for the appraisal of children's expressive vocabulary skill.\nPMID:\n38838249\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00457",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This study explored the acceptability and impact of relationship-centered communication partner training (RC-CPT) in couples impacted by aphasia. In particular, couples considered whether discussing their relationship roles and responsibilities was important and relevant to the changes they desire. Preliminary quasi-experimental data regarding perceived communication confidence and the marriage relationship were also obtained.\nMETHOD: Three couples participated in RC-CPT across two sessions. Surveys were used to measure communication confidence and the marital relationship before and after participation in RC-CPT. The quantitative findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Couples also participated in a semistructured interview about the acceptability of RC-CPT during a third session. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using reflexive codebook analysis.\nRESULTS: Quantitative data indicated that participants generally maintained or improved self-rated accessibility, responsiveness, engagement, conflict resolution, and communication within their marriage after participating in RC-CPT. Additionally, individuals with aphasia demonstrated enhanced communication confidence scores. Qualitative analysis revealed three themes: (a) Impact on Communication, (b) Impact on Relationship, and (c) Impact on Psychosocial Well-Being. Feedback from participants regarding future development was also included.\nCONCLUSIONS: The convergence of quantitative and qualitative data supports the conclusion that couples experienced positive changes in their communication, relationship, and psychosocial well-being during the intervention, suggesting that RC-CPT has the potential to positively impact both communicative and psychosocial effects of aphasia on couples. Moreover, this study highlights the promise of RC-CPT as a relationship-centered counseling tool, warranting further exploratory and experimental research.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25937383.\nPMID:\n38838246\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00348",

Most therapy sessions were conducted via telehealth, with two participants completing the SPEAK OUT! portion in person. Speech samples were recorded at six time points: three baseline time points prior to SPEAK OUT!, two post-SPEAK OUT! time points, and one post-LOUD Crowd time point. Acoustic measures of speaking rate and percent pause time and listener ratings of speech intelligibility and naturalness were obtained for each time point. Participant self-ratings of communicative participation were also collected at pre- and posttreatment time points.\nRESULTS: Results showed significant improvement in communicative participation scores at a group level following completion of the SPEAK OUT! & LOUD Crowd treatment program. Two participants showed a significant decrease in speaking rate and increase in percent pause time following treatment. Changes in intelligibility and naturalness were not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the SPEAK OUT! & LOUD Crowd treatment program in improving communicative participation for people with mild-to-moderate hypokinetic dysarthria secondary to PD. This study is also the first to demonstrate positive effects of this treatment program for people receiving the therapy via telehealth.\nPMID:\n38838243\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00321",

Using mixed methods, this study aimed to understand literacy experiences described by individuals with aphasia and explore how their perspectives are related to test performance and other demographic factors.\nMETHOD: Twenty-one stroke survivors with aphasia completed reading and writing testing and shared their perspectives through a close-ended survey and an open-ended interview about literacy abilities and experiences. Quantitative methods were used to compare pre- and poststroke self-ratings and explore associations between self-ratings and demographic factors. Qualitative methods were used to identify themes in the interviews. The data sets were merged to derive mixed-methods results for a more in-depth view of participants' perspectives.\nRESULTS: Significant decreases in perceived literacy abilities were found; however, there were no differences in literacy importance or enjoyment pre- to poststroke. Reading and writing test scores were correlated with self-rated abilities but not with importance, enjoyment, or frequency of reading and writing. The thematic analysis process identified four main themes:\nFeelings about literacy\n,\nLiteracy challenges\n,\nLiteracy supports\n, and\nLiteracy goals\n.\nCONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that individuals with aphasia highly value reading and writing and are heavily invested, despite recognized challenges, in using and improving these skills. Therefore, assessments and treatments addressing literacy in aphasia are critical, and individuals with aphasia should be invited to share their literacy experiences and goals, allowing for more person-centered clinical resources to be collaboratively constructed.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25893049.\nPMID:\n38820595\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00360",

Each speaker was paired with a typical interlocutor over videoconferencing software. The speakers produced the vowels /i, ɪ, ɛ, æ/ in /h/-vowel-/d/ words. For the solo tasks, speakers read the stimuli aloud in both their habitual and clear speaking styles. For the interactive task, speakers produced a target stimulus for their interlocutor to select among the four possibilities. We measured the duration difference between long and short vowels, as well as the F1/F2 Euclidean distance between adjacent vowels, and also determined how well the vowels could be classified based on their acoustic characteristics.\nRESULTS: Temporal contrast between long and short vowels was higher in the interactive task than in both solo tasks. Spectral distance between adjacent vowel pairs was also higher for some pairs in the interactive task than the habitual speech task. Finally, vowel classification accuracy was highest in the interactive task.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found evidence that individuals with dysarthria produced vowels with greater acoustic contrast in structured interactions than they did in solo tasks. Furthermore, the speech adjustments they made to the vowel segments differed from those observed in solo speech.\nPMID:\n38809826\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_AJSLP-23-00372",

Recently, there has been growing evidence of public health concept applications in fields related to speech, language, and hearing. However, there is an outstanding need to explicitly define the intersection of public health, including prevention and health promotion, and the discipline of communication sciences and disorders (CSD) across the areas of education, clinical practice, research, and policy. The authors propose a definition for this intersection using the new term\ncommunication public health\n.\nMETHOD: This tutorial provides guidance on how to conceptualize communication public health and invites refinement and expansion of the intersection between public health and CSD. Because readers are experts in CSD, this tutorial aims to supplement existing knowledge with information on public health to achieve three main objectives: (a) increase knowledge of the application of public health concepts among speech, language, hearing, and related professionals (SLHP+); (b) introduce the concept of communication public health; and (c) discuss the relevance of communication public health across domains within CSD. The authors utilize the socioecological model to provide examples of applications.\nRESULTS: The concept of communication public health is proposed as the collaborative area of CSD and public health, which encompasses prevention and promotion of equity in communication health through individual-, community-, and population-level efforts. The goals of communication public health are achieved through applications of public health principles in CSD education, clinical practice, research, and policy.\nCONCLUSION: Communication public health defines an area of collaboration between public health and CSD in which SLHP+ can apply public health concepts to both advance communication health and address health disparities.\nPMID:\n39083459\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00491",

All children underwent speech-ABR testing, cognitive assessment using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, and a continuous performance test.\nRESULTS: Children with ADHD exhibited significantly longer latencies of speech-ABR waveforms V, A, and D compared to TD children. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the latencies of speech-ABR waves V, A, and D were affected by the presence of ADHD, but not by the full-scale intelligence quotient.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that preschool children with ADHD exhibited abnormal AP of speech signals in their CANS. The findings suggest that speech-ABR can be utilized as a reliable measure to evaluate AP ability in this population, as it remains unaffected by cognitive or attentional factors. The transient response (V, A) of speech-ABR was found to be a significant predictor of ADHD in a clinical setting. Early assessment of AP abnormalities via speech-ABR is recommended in preschool-age children to develop targeted interventions for ADHD.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26376502.\nPMID:\n39083453\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00454",

Analyses were primarily descriptive and relied on distribution-free medians, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), and population-weighted prevalence estimates. Differences between CDFs were examined using Cohen's\nh\neffect size. Results are presented for the age range of 6-19 years. Main effects of sex, age, and race/ethnicity were examined.\nRESULTS: Differences in the audiograms between the sexes and among the various race/ethnicity groups were minor, but age group differences were notable. Pure-tone thresholds at 500 and 8000 Hz for the 6- to 9-year age group were 3-5 dB higher (worse) than those of the other age groups. The overall prevalence of hearing loss among 6- to 19-year-olds, defined as either of the pure-tone averages (PTAs) for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz (PTA512) or 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz (PTA3468k) exceeding 15 dB HL in either ear, was 11.24% (95% confidence interval [10.00%, 12.48%]). Binary logistic regression analyses found the odds of hearing loss to be significantly higher for individuals from families with a low income as well as for those with abnormal otoscopy or abnormal tympanometry.\nCONCLUSIONS: For children and adolescents in the United States, hearing was unaffected by differences in sex and race/ethnicity, with only age impacting pure-tone thresholds and only at the lowest (500 Hz) and highest (8000 Hz) frequencies examined. The overall prevalence of hearing loss was about 11%.\nPMID:\n39083446\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00050",

Previous studies suggest that young Arabic and Hebrew speakers' early verb use is based on semantic complexity rather than derivational morphological structure. The present study examines the role of morphological and semantic complexity in the emergence of the verb\nderivational\nmorphology in Arabic speaking children with developmental language disorder (DLD) compared to children with typical language development (TLD).\nMETHOD: Natural language data were collected from native Arabic-speaking children (40 with DLD; aged 4-6 years and 133 with TLD aged 2;6-6;0 [years;months]) using picture-based elicitation tasks, and verbs were coded morphologically for derivational features and for features of semantic complexity.\nRESULTS: The results showed that children with DLD demonstrated a more limited production of verb patterns, both in types and in tokens, than age-matched children with TLD. Also, children with DLD age 5;0-6;0 were similar in types and tokens of verb patterns to younger children with TLD at the age of 3;6-4 years. Moreover, while children with TLD at the age of 2;6-3 years used a smaller number of verb patterns than older 4;0-5;0 aged children with DLD, the two groups were not different in verb semantics. Finally, the morphological and semantic diversity demonstrated by the children with DLD was similar to the morphological and semantic diversity shown by children with TLD.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings support the conclusion that children with DLD and with TLD acquire the derivational verb system in the same pathway and the quantitative lexical differences between the two groups support a delay rather than a deviation from the typical developmental trajectory.\nPMID:\n39058937\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00558",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Target word activation in picture naming was explored in children who stutter (CWS) and typically fluent children (TFC) using event-related potentials (ERPs).\nMETHOD: A total of 18 CWS and 16 TFC completed a task combining picture naming and probe word identification. On each trial, a picture-to-be-named was followed by an auditory probe word-to-be-identified; the probe was identical (Identity condition) or Unrelated to the picture name. ERPs were recorded from probe onset. Attenuation of the N400 ERP component was predicted to Identity versus Unrelated trials (N400 priming). Between-groups differences in amplitude, timing, and topography of N400 priming were explored.\nRESULTS: Naming was more accurate on Identity versus Unrelated trials. Probe word identification accuracy was not affected by Condition. N400 priming was detected, indicating that self-generated picture names facilitated semantic processing of identical probes. This effect was larger in amplitude in CWS versus TFC. Unexpectedly, an N400-preceding, frontally maximal, positive-going ERP component-associated with expectancy processing-was larger in amplitude to Unrelated versus Identity trials. This effect was smaller in CWS versus TFC.\nCONCLUSIONS: A larger N400 priming effect in CWS versus TFC reflects a tendency toward more extensive semantic processing in picture naming in CWS. A smaller Condition effect on frontally maximal, positive-going, N400-preceding ERP activity in CWS versus TFC indicates a reduced ability to form expectancies about the lexical and/or phonological identity of probe words in CWS. Both effects may point to inefficient activation of target words in picture naming in CWS.\nPMID:\n39058928\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00570",

All children were assessed in Italian on vocabulary, receptive morphosyntax, and morphological markers for DLD in the Italian language (i.e., third-person verb inflections, definite articles, third-person direct-object clitic pronouns, simple prepositions) and nonverbal inhibitory control skills. Group performance was compared using a series of one-way analyses of variance.\nRESULTS: Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD achieved significantly lower performance in all language measures compared to both TD monolingual and bilingual children. However, TD bilinguals, although comprehensively showing better language skills than monolinguals with DLD, achieved a performance closer to that of monolinguals with DLD but significantly higher than that of bilinguals with DLD. Both TD monolinguals and bilinguals showed better results than both DLD groups in inhibitory control tasks, particularly in the interference suppression task.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides a picture of language and inhibitory control characteristics of children with various language profiles and adds to the literature on potential markers of DLD among bilingual children. These results suggest that the assessment of nonlinguistic markers, which are associated with language impairment, could be a useful approach to better specify the diagnosis of DLD and reduce cases of misdiagnosis in the context of bilingualism.\nPMID:\n39058921\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00368",

These tasks consisted of speech and nonspeech stimuli differing in spectral or temporal cues. We then used independent-samples\nt\n-tests to assess differences in phonetic categorization slopes between groups and linear mixed-effects models to test differences in nonspeech auditory processing between stuttering and nonstuttering groups, and stuttering severity as a function of performance on all auditory processing tasks.\nRESULTS: We found statistically significant differences between people who do and do not stutter in phonetic categorization of a continuum differing in a temporal cue and in discrimination of nonspeech stimuli differing in a spectral cue. A significant proportion of variance in self-reported stuttering severity was predicted by performance on the auditory processing measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that people who stutter process both speech and nonspeech auditory information differently than people who do not stutter and may point to subtle differences in auditory processing that could contribute to stuttering.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This article describes DigiSpan, a new computer-controlled auditory test of forward and reverse digit span, designed to be administered by clinicians, and presents normative and test-retest reliability data for adults.\nMETHOD: DigiSpan mimics conventional live-voice tests in that it commences with trials that ascend in length until a stopping criterion is met, giving rise to a conventional scaled score. It then administers five additional adaptive trials, the length of which depends on the correctness of the response to the previous trial. Each of these two segments of the measurement gives rise to a scaled score. The ascending and adaptive scores are averaged to give an overall score and subtracted to produce an internal measure of consistency, and hence reliability. Young adults with an\nM\nage\nof 25 years (\nN\n= 163) were tested, of whom 65 were retested on a separate day.\nRESULTS: The scaled scores from the conventional ascending trials were highly consistent with existing normative data based on live-voice tests. Combination of the conventional scaled score with a scaled score based on the adaptive trials led to 44% reduction in error variance for forward memory span and 20% reduction for reverse memory span. The average of these (32%) is similar to but (insignificantly) less than the 42% reduction in error variance that can be predicted based on adding the five adaptive trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: Replacing live-voice production of digits by a clinician with recorded, computer-controlled production has not affected the difficulty of the test. Adding five additional trials around the sequence length that a test participant can just remember has produced a decrease in measurement error. In addition, the availability of separate scaled scores for the ascending and adaptive phases enables the reliability of the combined score to be checked, for both forward and reverse measurements. The combination of standardized delivery, increased accuracy, internal reliability check, and fast automated scoring makes the test highly suitable for clinical use.\nPMID:\n39052433\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00466",

This study examined to what extent narrative discourse comprehension accounts for narrative discourse production outcomes (story grammar, story completeness). A secondary aim was to provisionally test an assumption of a discourse model, the structure building framework (SBF), that discourse comprehension and production share cognitive processes by investigating the strength of the relationship between them.\nMETHOD: Twenty-one individuals with TBI completed story comprehension and story retelling tasks. Discourse measures included the Discourse Comprehension Test, a picture story comprehension task, story grammar, and story completeness. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were performed using comprehension measures as predictors for production measures.\nRESULTS: There were significant moderate-to-large correlations between all comprehension and production measures. Comprehension measures approached but did not reach significance for predicting story grammar performance but strongly predicted story completeness outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The story comprehension measures likely tapped content aspects of discourse more so than organization. Results provided support for a link between content-focused discourse comprehension measures and discourse production outcomes, which may have clinical implications for approaches to discourse intervention. Findings were interpreted as providing preliminary support for the SBF's claim that discourse production deploys the same processes involved in discourse comprehension.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26338045.\nPMID:\n39052432\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00681",

The developmental trajectory of gesture production during early childhood is understudied. Thus, little is known about the possible changes of gesture production over time.

Their speech was transcribed, and their gestures were coded from parent-child interaction. Multilevel modeling analysis was used to investigate the development of gesture and its associated factors.\nRESULTS: The total number of gestures produced by autistic children decreased over time. Among different factors, children's initial age significantly and negatively predicted children's gesture production, while initial language positively predicted children's gesture production.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gesture delay persists in preschool age. The decline in gesture production was associated with children's age and initial language ability.

A common procedural learning task, serial reaction time (SRT), has been used to develop models of the basis of DLD. However, paradigms involve differing levels of implicit and explicit learning during this task, muddying interpretations of the data. Here, we tested adults with DLD on implicit and explicit SRT tasks to better understand implicit and explicit procedural learning in this population. We hypothesized that adults with DLD would demonstrate reduced learning on only the implicit SRT task, as alternate explicit neural mechanisms could lead to equivalent performance on the explicit task.\nMETHOD: Fifty participants (25 with DLD and 25 with typical language) completed implicit and explicit SRT tasks, measuring their ability to learn visually presented 10-element sequences. Group differences were evaluated on sequence learning, error rates, and explicit recall of the sequence after learning.\nRESULTS: Sequence learning was the same between the groups on both tasks. However, individuals with DLD showed increased errors and significantly worse recall of the explicitly learned sequence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that sequence learning may be intact in this population, while aspects of explicit learning and motoric responses are impaired. Results are interpreted in light of a neurobiological model of DLD.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26210651.\nPMID:\n39024517\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00551",

While the integration of mHealth with adult populations currently supports a wide array of hearing services, a better understanding of the implementation across the lifespan is needed. Literature surrounding the unique population of adolescent hearing aid users is currently lacking. Research is needed to highlight factors important to the use and clinical integration of mHealth hearing aid applications (apps) with adolescents. This study explored two primary objectives: (a) audiologists' perceptions around the use of mHealth apps to enable collaborative, child-inclusive hearing aid personalization, and (b) person-centered ideation around potential app design components to benefit users aged 12 to 17 years.\nMETHOD: Twelve audiologists participated in virtual synchronous focus groups, across three group sessions using Cisco Webex. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an inductive, codebook thematic analysis approach.\nRESULTS: Six main themes resulted from group discussion analyses: (a) client candidacy: characteristics impacting suitability for mHealth use; (b) clinical implementation: organizational, professional, or patient-level strategies for mHealth adoption; (c) collaboration: the use of two or more individuals working together; (d) empowerment: process of acquiring and using knowledge, skills, and strategies; (e) remote technology: technologies enabling remote hearing aid personalization; and (f) application functionality and design: features and characteristics important to an adolescent-focused app.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings identified the potential for clinical integration of hearing aid apps with adolescents in a collaborative care model, including consideration of child-specific use patterns, outcomes, and key design and technology components to support real-world implementation and use. Results may guide development and tailoring efforts around existing and future hearing aid apps for use with adolescent populations.\nPMID:\n39018271\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00679",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a visual cognitive additional task on balance performance in young adults with hearing aids (HAs).\nMETHOD: Twenty young adult HA users and 20 controls were recruited for the study. Participants were asked to stand on a force plate using computerized dynamic posturography and perform a Sensory Organization Test (SOT) as a balance task under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. The DT condition involved performing a visual cognitive task (Backward Digit Recall) while maintaining balance. Balance performance was measured using equilibrium scores under four different conditions.\nRESULTS: The results showed that SOT scores of HA users decreased significantly in the DT compared to the ST (\np\nof Condition 1: < .001;\np\nof Condition 4: < .001;\np\nof Condition 6: = .001). HA users' SOT scores in the DT condition were statistically significantly lower than controls (\np\nof Condition 1: < .003;\np\nof Condition 4: < .009;\np\nof Condition 6: = .004). This suggests that the presence of a visual cognitive additional task has a negative impact on balance performance in young adults with HAs.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of cognitive tasks on balance performance in young adults with HAs. Further studies should investigate the specific needs of hearing loss patients in multitasking conditions, including age, degree of hearing loss, and cognitive ability, to develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of falls.\nPMID:\n39018264\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00530",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Linguistic prosody is affected in Parkinson's disease (PD), which implicates the basal ganglia's role in the production of prosody. However, there is no recent systematic synthesis of the available acoustic evidence of prosodic impairment in PD. This study aimed to identify the acoustic features of linguistic prosody that are consistently affected in PD.\nMETHOD: The authors systematically reviewed articles that reported acoustic features of prosodic production in PD. Articles focused on fundamental frequency (\nF\n0) and its variability, intensity and its variability, speech and articulation rate, and pause duration and ratio. From a total of 648 records identified, 36 met criteria for inclusion and exclusion. For each acoustic measurement and task, data from people with PD (PwPD) were compared with those from controls to extract effect sizes. Pooled effect sizes were estimated using robust Bayesian hierarchical regression models.\nRESULTS: PD was associated with decreased\nF\n0 variability and increased pause duration. There was limited evidence of reduced intensity variability and speech rate in PwPD. No evidence was found to suggest that PD affects articulation rate or pause ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: The primary acoustic parameters of prosody affected by PD are\nF\n0 variability and pause duration. The identification of these acoustic parameters has important clinical implications for the selection of PD management strategies. The association of\nF\n0 variability and pause duration with PD suggests that the neural circuits controlling these parameters are at least partly shared and might include the basal ganglia. While the current study focused on the phonetic realization of prosodic cues, future studies should examine whether and how PD affects prosody at higher levels of processing.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25892923.\nPMID:\n39018262\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00588",

The\nF\nmeasure determines the accuracy of IDEAS diarization (i.e., speech segmentation and speaker classification). Two additional evaluation metrics, namely, median absolute relative error and correlation, indicate the accuracy of IDEAS for the estimation of linguistic units as compared with two conditions, namely, Oracle (manual diarization) and Voice Type Classifier (existing diarizer with acceptable accuracy).\nRESULTS: The high\nF\nmeasure for SLP talk data suggests high accuracy of IDEAS diarization for SLP talk but less so for child talk. These differences are reflected in the accuracy of IDEAS linguistic unit estimates. IDEAS median absolute relative error and correlation values for nine of the 10 SLP linguistic unit estimates meet the accuracy criteria, but none of the child linguistic unit estimates meet these criteria. The type of linguistic units also affects IDEAS accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: IDEAS was tailored to educational settings to automatically convert audio recordings into text and to provide linguistic unit estimates in speech-language therapy sessions and classroom settings. Although not perfect, IDEAS is reliable in automatically capturing and returning linguistic units, especially in SLP talk, that are relevant in research and practice. The tool offers a way to automatically measure SLP talk in clinical settings, which will support research seeking to understand how SLP talk influences children's language growth.\nPMID:\n39018260\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00310",

The main aim of this work was to investigate the content and construct validity of the German Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI-D) by comparison with the German Voice Handicap Index 9 international (VHI9i) and the Vocal Tract Discomfort Scale (VTD). Moreover, the scale and retest reliability were investigated.\nMETHOD: In a prospective cohort study at two tertiary care hospitals, 93 adults with all types of voice complaints filled out the VFI-D, the VHI-9i, and the VTD. Eighty-one adults (\nM\nage\n= 53.5 years,\nSD\n= 15.7) completed them one time, and additional 12 patients (\nM\nage\n= 53.8 years,\nSD\n= 15.6) did a test-retest, completed them twice at an interval of 1 week. The validity was assessed by Spearman's rho and Mokken scaling and the reliability by a factor analysis and a two-tailed\nt\ntest.\nRESULTS: Mokken scaling has proven the VFI-D as one-dimensional questionnaire (one cluster,\nr\n= .95). All VFI-D items could be assigned to one of three factors according to principal component and principal axis factor analysis. Although Factor 1 related best to the VHI9i (∅\nr\ns\n= .76) and Factor 2 to the VTD (∅\nr\ns\n= .74), Factor 3 correlated moderately with the VHI9i (\nr\ns\n= .34) and weakly with the VTD (\nr\ns\n= .25). Results from the first and second VFI-D completion agreed strongly (\nt\n= -1.78,\np\n= .10).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, the content and construct validity of the VFI-D were confirmed. Also, both scale reliability with identical factors as those in the original study and retest reliability were verified. The VHI9i and VTD were highly indicative of VFI-D Factors 1 and 2, respectively. No correlation between Factor 3 and the other questionnaires was determined. Future research should evaluate which characteristics are specific to vocal fatigue versus general voice disorder-related symptoms.\nPMID:\n39018253\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00481",

At 12 months after CI activation, parents were asked to endorse words that their child could understand only or understand and say using the infant version of the Early Vocabulary Inventory. At 24 months after CI activation, parents were asked to endorse the grammatical structures that their children were able to say using the Grammatical Complexity subtest in the Mandarin Communicative Development Inventory-Taiwan. Children's receptive/expressive noun and verb lexicon sizes and grammatical complexity scores were computed from these parent checklists.\nRESULTS: Correlational analyses showed that children's receptive/expressive noun and verb lexicon sizes at 12 months after CI activation were all highly correlated with their grammatical complexity scores at 24 months after CI activation (ρs = .52-.63,\np\ns < .001). Regression analyses further revealed that verb lexicon sizes at 12 months after CI activation outweighed noun lexicon sizes in accounting for grammatical complexity at 24 months after CI activation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings supported the prediction of the sentence-focused framework.

Previous videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS) in PwALS do not account for the influence of senescence. We aimed to compare swallowing in PwALS and an age- and sex-matched control group using healthy reference data to define typical and atypical values.\nMETHOD: We conducted retrospective analysis of VFSS data from 19 PwALS (10 male,\nM\nage\n= 63 years, range: 47-82) compared to control data from a cohort of healthy adults. Participants swallowed 20% w/v liquid barium from thin to extremely thick consistency. Blinded duplicate VFSS analysis using the ASPEKT (Analysis of Swallowing Physiology: Events, Kinematics and Timing) method yielded descriptive statistics for 16 quantitative VFSS parameters by consistency. Mann-Whitney\nU\ntests were used to identify significant cohort differences. Additionally, the frequencies of atypical values (in the 25% tails of the reference distribution) were tabulated by cohort and compared using odds ratios.\nRESULTS: PwALS showed increased frequencies of multiple swallows per bolus, incomplete laryngeal vestibule closure, and reduced hyoid speed across consistencies. By contrast, similar frequencies of atypical values for pharyngeal constriction and residue in both cohorts suggest that age-related changes may contribute to the presence of these features in PwALS.\nCONCLUSIONS: This analysis builds on previous descriptions of swallowing pathophysiology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by clarifying the extent to which aging may account for some of the atypical findings seen in this patient population. Longitudinal studies are recommended to further differentiate the effects of ALS from age-related changes in swallowing over the course of disease progression.\nPMID:\n39007704\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00106",

This study examined the interplay between age-related hearing loss, cognitive decline, and social isolation in adults by testing the ability to understand speech in background noise, a challenge frequently reported by many older adults.\nMETHOD: We analyzed data collected from 128 adults (20-79 years of age,\nM\nage\n= 51 years) recruited as part of the Aging Brain Cohort at the University of South Carolina repository. The participants underwent testing for hearing, cognition, and social interaction, which included pure-tone audiometry, a words-in-noise (WIN) test, a hearing questionnaire (Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale [SSQ12]), a social questionnaire (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-57 Social), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We used a single pure-tone average (PTA) threshold value and a single WIN threshold value for each participant because there were no differences on average between the left and right ears.\nRESULTS: Poorer hearing was significantly associated with cognitive decline, through both PTA and WIN thresholds, with a stronger association observed for WIN threshold. Adults with poorer hearing also exhibited greater social isolation, as evidenced by their WIN threshold and SSQ12 score, although not through PTA. This connection was more pronounced with the WIN threshold than with the SSQ12 score. Cognition was not related to social isolation, suggesting that social isolation is affected more by the ability to understand words in noise than by cognition in a nondemented population.\nCONCLUSIONS: Understanding speech in challenging auditory environments rather than mere threshold detection is strongly linked to social isolation and cognitive decline. Thus, inclusion of a word-recognition-in-noise test and a social isolation survey in clinical settings is warranted.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26237060.\nPMID:\n38995870\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00810",

A series of psychometric validation experiments are reported.\nMETHOD: Using a computational model that enables estimation of item difficulty at the lexical and sublexical stages of word retrieval, two complimentary sets of items were constructed that challenge the respective psycholinguistic levels of representation. The difference in accuracy between these item sets yields the relative linguistic impairment (RLI) score. In a cohort of 91 people with chronic left-hemisphere stroke who enrolled in a clinical trial for anomia, we assessed psychometric properties of the RLI score and then used the new scale to make predictions about other language behaviors, lesion distributions, and functional activation during naming.\nRESULTS: RLI scores had adequate psychometric properties for clinical significance. RLI scores contained predictive information about spontaneous speech fluency, over and above accuracy. A dissociation was observed between performance on the RLI item sets and performance on the subtests of an independent language battery. Sublexical RLI was significantly associated with apraxia of speech and with lesions encompassing perisylvian regions, while lexical RLI was associated with lesions to deep white matter. The RLI construct was reflected in functional brain activity during naming, independent of overall accuracy, with a respective shift of activation between dorsal and ventral networks responsible for different aspects of word retrieval.\nCONCLUSION: The RLI assessment satisfies the psychometric requirements to serve as a useful clinical measure.\nPMID:\n38995869\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00439",

Combining data from the current and a prior study, we explore how the speech levels of both interlocutors correlate and relate to HI interlocutors' degree of hearing loss.\nMETHOD: Sixteen pairs of younger NH and elderly HI interlocutors conversed in quiet, with the HI interlocutor either unaided or wearing HAs. We analyzed the effect of hearing status and HA amplification on the conversational dynamics, including turn-taking times (floor-transfer offsets), utterance lengths, and speech levels. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the speech levels using combined data sets from the current and previously published data by Petersen, MacDonald, and Sørensen (2022).\nRESULTS: Unaided HI interlocutors were slower and more variable at timing their turns, but wearing HAs reduced the differences between the HI and NH interlocutors. Conversations were less interactive, and pairs were slower at solving the conversational tasks when the HI interlocutor was unaided. Both interlocutors spoke louder when the HI interlocutor was unaided. The speech level of the NH interlocutors was related to that of the HI interlocutors, with the HI speech levels also correlating with their own degree of hearing loss.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite typically being unchallenging for HI individuals, one-on-one conversations in quiet were impacted by the HI interlocutor not wearing HAs. Additionally, combining data sets revealed that NH interlocutors adjusted their speech level to match that of HI interlocutors.\nPMID:\n38995861\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00667",

Unfortunately, gaps between the laboratory, clinic, and classroom can emerge in part because of siloing of data and workflows, as well as the digital divide between users. The purpose of this tutorial is to present the Collaboverse, a web-based collaborative system that unifies these domains, and describe the application of this tool to common tasks in speech-language pathology. In addition, we demonstrate its utility in machine learning (ML) applications.\nMETHOD: This tutorial outlines key concepts in the digital divide, data management, distributed computing, and ML. It introduces the Collaboverse workspace for researchers, clinicians, and educators in speech-language pathology who wish to improve their collaborative network and leverage advanced computation abilities. It also details an ML approach to prosodic analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Collaboverse shows promise in narrowing the digital divide and is capable of generating clinically relevant data, specifically in the area of prosody, whose computational complexity has limited widespread analysis in research and clinic alike. In addition, it includes an augmentative and alternative communication app allowing visual, nontextual communication.\nPMID:\n38995859\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00286",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Treatment response is the degree to which an individual benefits from a treatment. This systematic review sought to identify and synthesize research evidence regarding individual characteristics that predict language treatment response among children with developmental language disorder (DLD).\nMETHOD: To be eligible for inclusion, articles needed to report results of an oral language treatment program in a group of children aged 4-10 years with identified DLD and also include a quantitative analysis of the relation between one or more pretreatment child characteristics and the outcome of language treatment. Seven databases (Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Dissertations and Theses Global, Education Resources Information Center, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, and Web of Science) were searched for articles in June and July 2021, with search updates conducted in May 2023. Studies were categorized by the type of treatment provided, and results were synthesized qualitatively.\nRESULTS: The review included 31 studies, 1,551 participants with DLD, and over 300 statistical tests of a predictor's effect on language treatment response. Most studies (\nn\n= 21) included only monolingual speakers of English, with five studies including bilinguals and five including monolingual speakers of non-English languages. Language treatments targeted word learning in controlled or clinical conditions, grammatical learning in controlled or clinical conditions, or multiple language targets in clinical conditions. Predictors of treatment response are summarized across four categories: cognitive, demographic, pretreatment language levels, and other.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were relatively few significant tests of the predictors of language treatment response. A central limitation of the evidence is that most included studies were designed to consider language treatment efficacy, not predictors of treatment response. Increasing research attention to the question of predictors of language treatment response in children with DLD is needed to enhance treatment and optimize outcomes for individual children.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26170006.\nPMID:\n38991168\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00665",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, ultimately fatal disease causing progressive muscular weakness. Most people living with ALS (plwALS) experience dysarthria, eventually becoming unable to communicate using natural speech. Many wish to use speech for as long as possible. Personalized automated speech recognition (ASR) model technology, such as Google's Project Relate, is argued to better recognize speech with dysarthria, supporting maintenance of understanding through real-time captioning. The objectives of this study are how plwALS and communication partners use Relate in everyday conversation over a period of up to 12 months and how it may change with any decline in speech over time.\nMETHOD: This study videoed interactions between three plwALS and communication partners. We assessed ASR caption accuracy and how well they preserved meaning. Conversation analysis was used to identify participants' own organizational practices in the accomplishment of interaction. Thematic analysis was used to understand better the participants' experiences of using ASR captions.\nRESULTS: All plwALS reported lower-than-expected ASR accuracy when used in conversation and felt ASR captioning was only useful in certain contexts. All participants liked the concept of live captioning and were hopeful that future improvements to ASR accuracy may support their communication in everyday life.\nCONCLUSIONS: Training is needed on best practices for customization and practical use of ASR technology and for the limitations of ASR in conversational settings. Support is needed for those less confident with technology and to reduce misplaced allocation of ownership of captioning errors, risking negative effects on psychological well-being.\nPMID:\n38991167\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00097",

This review article reviews various modalities of health information that are useful for developing such remote clinical assessments in the real world at scale.\nAPPROACH: We first present an overview of the various modalities of health information-speech acoustics, natural language, conversational dynamics, orofacial or full body movement, eye gaze, respiration, cardiopulmonary, and neural-which can each be extracted from various signal sources-audio, video, text, or sensors. We further motivate their clinical utility with examples of how information from each modality can help us characterize how different disorders affect different aspects of patients' spoken communication. We then elucidate the advantages of combining one or more of these modalities toward a more holistic, informative, and robust assessment.\nFINDINGS: We find that combining multiple modalities of health information allows for improved scientific interpretability, improved performance on downstream health applications such as early detection and progress monitoring, improved technological robustness, and improved user experience. We illustrate how these principles can be leveraged for remote clinical assessment at scale using a real-world case study of the Modality assessment platform.\nCONCLUSION: This review article motivates the combination of human-centric information from multiple modalities to measure various aspects of patients' health, arguing that remote clinical assessment that integrates this complementary information can be more effective and lead to better clinical outcomes than using any one data stream in isolation.\nPMID:\n38984943\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00142",

Previous studies have focused on undetected delays in young children. Much less is known about referrals at older ages. In this study, we aimed to (a) establish how many children are referred at toddler age (2-3 years) and how many at lower elementary (4-7 years), upper elementary (8-12 years), and high school (13-16 years) age; (b) evaluate characteristics of the referred children and adolescents across age groups; and (c) assess whether the ensuing classification (no language disorder [LD], developmental LD, LD + additional problems) differed across age groups.\nMETHOD: We used the 2010-2014 database of the Dutch federation of speech and hearing centers, containing 18,894 cases with target ages. We established the number of referrals in each age group (Q1) and assessed the composition of the age groups in terms of speech, language, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes (Q2), as well as in terms of classification (Q3). To answer Q2 and Q3, we conducted chi-squared analyses with the toddler group as reference group.\nRESULTS: Late-identified LDs exist: There were new referrals in all age groups. Compared to older age groups, the toddler group contained fewer girls and multilingual children. The toddler group also contained fewer children without an LD and more children with LD + additional problems.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, children with multiple language problems are referred earliest. However, late-identified LDs exist, even at high school age. Girls and multilingual children tend to be missed at younger ages. More work on awareness and identification of language delays is needed, requiring awareness, knowledge, and tools for educational professionals.\nPMID:\n38984930\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00540",

The goal of this study was to examine how attention to respiratory sensations may influence these processes in aging speakers with dyspnea, by measuring the effect of sensory monitoring on the relationship between utterance length and the occurrence of inspirations, as well as on functional voice and respiratory measures.\nMETHOD: Seventeen adults aged 50 years and older with complaints of voicing-related dyspnea completed a repeated-measures protocol consisting of a 2-week baseline phase and a 4-week sensory monitoring phase. Audiovisual recordings of semistructured speech and self-report questionnaires were collected at study onset, after the baseline phase, and after the sensory monitoring phase. Repeated-measures logistic regressions were conducted to examine changes in the relationship between utterance length and the occurrence of inspirations in adjacent pauses, and repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to investigate any changes in functional voice and respiratory measures.\nRESULTS: Planning and recovery processes appeared to remain constant across the baseline phase. From postbaseline to postsensory monitoring timepoints, a strengthening of the relationship between the presence of an inspiration during a speech pause and the length of the subsequent-but not preceding-utterance was noted. Significant improvements were noted in voice-related handicap from study onset to postsensory monitoring, but no changes were reported in respiratory comfort during speech.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that respiratory planning processes, that is, the ability to plan breath intakes based on the length of upcoming utterances, may be modifiable behaviorally through targeted sensory monitoring. Further studies are warranted to validate the proposed role of respiratory sensation awareness in achieving skilled temporal coordination between voicing and breathing.\nPMID:\n38980884\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00673",

It examines the differences in narrative parameters between oral and written narratives and explores the associations between these parameters and cognitive and linguistic skills.\nMETHOD: The research involved 237 sixth-grade Arabic-speaking students from low-socioeconomic status schools in Israel. Each participant was instructed to orally tell a narrative and to write another narrative based on two sets of six sequential pictures. Various narrative features were analyzed, including word count for length, type-token ratio (TTR) for lexical diversity, mean length of utterance (MLU) for morphosyntax, and number of episodes for macrostructure. Cognitive linguistic measures, including Raven's Progressive Matrices, reading comprehension (RC), and morphological awareness (MA) were also assessed.\nRESULTS: The study found significant differences between oral and written narratives regarding lexical diversity and macrostructure. Participants exhibited significantly higher TTR in written narratives compared to oral narratives, whereas the number of episodes was significantly higher in oral narratives than in written ones. However, no significant differences were observed in narrative length or MLU. Moreover, the study identified significant predictors for various aspects of written narratives, particularly MA and RC, which significantly predicted TTR, MLU, and macrostructure. Additionally, the inclusion of word count in oral narratives significantly enhanced the explained variance for narrative length and macrostructure in written language.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of the oral-written interface in both micro- and macrostructure representations in both oral and written modalities.

We analyze the factors influencing this disparity and the effect of speech mode-specific training on ASR accuracy.\nMETHOD: Recordings of read and conversational speech from 27 individuals with various speech disorders were analyzed using both (a) one speaker-independent ASR system trained and optimized for typical speech and (b) multiple ASR models that were personalized to the speech of the participants with disordered speech. Word error rates were calculated for each speech model, read versus conversational, and subject. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the impact of speech mode and disorder severity on ASR accuracy. We investigated nine variables, classified as technical, linguistic, or speech impairment factors, for their potential influence on the performance gap.\nRESULTS: We found a significant performance gap between read and conversational speech in both personalized and unadapted ASR models. Speech impairment severity notably impacted recognition accuracy in unadapted models for both speech modes and in personalized models for read speech. Linguistic attributes of utterances were the most influential on accuracy, though atypical speech characteristics also played a role. Including conversational speech samples in model training notably improved recognition accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant performance gap in ASR accuracy between read and conversational speech for individuals with speech disorders. This gap was largely due to the linguistic complexity and unique characteristics of speech disorders in conversational speech. Training personalized ASR models using conversational speech significantly improved recognition accuracy, demonstrating the importance of domain-specific training and highlighting the need for further research into ASR systems capable of handling disordered conversational speech effectively.\nPMID:\n38963790\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-24-00045",

In the current study, we addressed whether written syntax features differed by language (English and Spanish) and varied as a function of grade level, English learner status, and instructional program (dual or English immersion). We also examined whether Spanish and English syntax features were related cross-linguistically and related to writing quality within languages and whether these relations to writing quality were moderated by grade level, English learner status, and instructional program.\nMETHOD: We examined written syntax features of Spanish and English essays by simultaneous and emergent bilinguals in Grades 1, 2, and 3 in either Spanish-English dual immersion or English immersion instruction in the United States (\nN\n= 278). Essays were scored for quality and evaluated for mean length of T-units, number of verbs, number of noun agreement words, and number of subject agreement words accurately conjugated.\nRESULTS: Written syntax features significantly differed by language and varied as a function of grade level, English learner status, and instructional program. Grades 2 and 3 wrote longer utterances, more verbs, and greater noun agreement accuracy than Grade 1. Syntax features were related to writing quality within languages, but Spanish relations were weaker for English learners than non-English learners and for dual immersion students than English immersion students.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest written syntax features may be useful for evaluation of English-Spanish simultaneous and emergent bilinguals' writing.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25927366.\nPMID:\n38963732\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00270",

This myoarchitecture cannot, however, explain independent tongue body and blade movement nor accurately model the subtlety of observed lingual shapes. This study presents the case for a finer neuromuscular structure and functional description.\nMETHOD: Using the theoretical framework of the partitioning hypothesis, evidence for neuromuscular compartments of each of the lingual muscles was discerned by reviewing studies of lingual anatomy, hypoglossal nerve staining, hypoglossal motoneuron axon tracing, muscle fiber type distribution, and electromyography. Muscle fibers of the visible human female were manually traced to produce a three-dimensional atlas of muscular compartments. A kinematic study was undertaken to determine the degree of independent movement between different parts of the tongue. A simple biomechanical model was used to demonstrate how synergistic groups of compartments can control sectors of the tongue.\nRESULTS: Results indicated as many as 10 compartments of genioglossus, two each of superior and inferior longitudinal, eight of styloglossus, three of hyoglossus, and six each of transversus and verticalis, while palatoglossus may not have a significant role in tongue function. Kinematic analysis indicated independent control of five sectors of the tongue body, and biomechanical modeling demonstrated how this control may be achieved.\nCONCLUSION: Evidence is presented for a lingual structure based on neuromuscular compartments, which work together to position and shape sectors of the tongue and independently control tongue body and blade.\nPMID:\n38959159\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00125",

This corpus was tested on a large cohort of U.S. Service members in order to examine the effects of talker nativeness, listener nativeness, masker type, and hearing sensitivity on speech recognition performance in this population.\nMETHOD: A total of 1,939 U.S. Service members (ages 18-68 years) completed this closed-set listening task, including 430 women and 110 nonnative English speakers. Stimuli were produced by native and nonnative speakers of English and were presented in speech-shaped noise and multitalker babble. Keyword recognition accuracy and response times were analyzed.\nRESULTS: General(ized) linear mixed-effects regression models found that, on the whole, speech recognition performance was lower for listeners who identified as nonnative speakers of English and when listening to speech produced by nonnative speakers of English. Talker and listener effects were more pronounced when listening in a babble masker than in a speech-shaped noise masker. Response times varied as a function of recognition score, with longest response times found for intermediate levels of performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study found additive effects of talker and listener nonnativeness when listening to speech in background noise. These effects were present in both accuracy and response time measures. No multiplicative effects of talker and listener language background were found. There was little evidence of a negative interaction between talker nonnativeness and hearing impairment, suggesting that these factors may have redundant effects on speech recognition.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26060191.\nPMID:\n38950169\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00312",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This study aims at investigating the phonological development of the six guttural consonants of Jordanian Arabic, /χ/, /ʁ/, /ħ/, /ʕ/, /ʔ/, and /h/.\nMETHOD: An articulation test is designed to involve two tasks: picture naming and repetition. The test includes 54 words for picture naming and 18 words for repetition, representing all possible positions of the targeted guttural sounds. Samples are collected from 40 typically developing Ammani-Jordanian Arabic-speaking monolingual children, living in Amman, Jordan. Respondents are equally divided into eight age-related trajectories: 2-2;6, 2;6-3, 3-3;6, 3;6-4, 4-4;6, 4;6-5, 5-5;6, and 5;6-6 (years;months). No child with a history of hearing, speech, or vision disorders is included. The data are analyzed using\nproduction accuracy\n, where the three developmental trajectories of production (customary, acquisition, and mastery) are determined for each guttural, and\nerror analysis\n, addressed based on perceptual judgments, providing details of every mispronounced or deleted guttural.\nRESULTS: The results show that /χ/, /ħ/, /ʕ/, and /ʔ/ are acquired before the age of 6 years, while /ʁ/ and /h/ are still not acquired by this age. Respondents use relatively variant alternatives for the mispronounced cognates, including guttural, nonguttural sounds, and vowel substitution. The /ʁ/ is the guttural with the highest number of alternatives, while /ʔ/ gets the least. The analysis also reveals patterns of guttural deletion, with variations across different guttural sounds and positions. Despite errors/deviations made, respondents score accuracy percentages that gradually increase in correlation with age. The guttural /ʁ/ starts with the lowest accuracy percentages, while /ʔ/ and /ħ/ start with the highest.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings illuminate on the developmental trajectory of guttural acquisition and enrich our understanding of children's evolving perception and production abilities. They offer valuable insights into the patterns of guttural sound production in Jordanian Arabic-speaking children, laying the groundwork for further research and the development of targeted assessment and intervention strategies to support phonological development in this population.\nPMID:\n38941556\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00085",

We first examined the relation between lexical morphology and phonological processes in typically developing readers (Study 1,\nN\n= 66,\nM\nage\n= 8.39), followed by a more focal inquiry into lexical morphology processes in dyslexia (Study 2,\nN\n= 50,\nM\nage\n= 8.62).\nRESULTS: Typical readers exhibited stronger engagement of language neurocircuitry during the morphology task relative to the phonology task, suggesting that morphological analyses involve synthesizing multiple components of sublexical processing. This effect was stronger for more analytically complex derivational affixes (\nlike + ly\n) than more semantically transparent free base morphemes (\nsnow + man\n). In contrast, children with dyslexia exhibited stronger activation during the free base condition relative to derivational affix condition. Taken together, the findings suggest that although children with dyslexia may struggle with derivational morphology, they may also use free base morphemes' semantic information to boost word recognition.\nCONCLUSION: This study informs literacy theories by identifying an interaction between reading ability, word structure, and how the developing brain learns to recognize words in speech and print.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25944949.\nPMID:\n38924392\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00293",

In this study, we developed a technique to holistically examine neural activity differences in speaking and silent reading conditions across the entire cortical surface. This approach allows us to test the hypothesis that AWS will exhibit lower separability of the speech motor planning condition.\nMETHOD: We used the silent reading condition as a control condition to isolate speech motor planning activity. We classified EEG signals from AWS and ANS individuals into speaking and silent reading categories using kernel support vector machines. We used relative complexities of the learned classifiers to compare speech motor planning discernibility for both classes.\nRESULTS: AWS group classifiers require a more complex decision boundary to separate speech motor planning and silent reading classes.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the EEG signals associated with speech motor planning are less discernible in AWS, which may result from altered neuronal dynamics in AWS. Our results support the hypothesis that AWS exhibit lower inherent separability of the silent reading and speech motor planning conditions. Further investigation may identify and compare the features leveraged for speech motor classification in AWS and ANS. These observations may have clinical value for developing novel speech therapies or assistive devices for AWS.\nPMID:\n38924389\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00635",

However, previous research utilizing RT in the context of language has largely overlooked the intra-individual variability (IIV) of RTs, which could hold significant information about the processes underlying language acquisition.\nMETHOD: We explored the association between language abilities and RT variability in visuomotor tasks using two data sets from previously published studies. The participants were 7- to 10-year-old children (\nn\n= 77).\nRESULTS: Our results suggest that increased variability in RTs is associated with weaker language abilities. Specifically, this within-participant variability in visuomotor RTs, especially the proportion of unusually slow responses, predicted language abilities better than mean RTs, a factor often linked to language skills in past research.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we introduce the IIV hypothesis in explaining individual differences in language development. According to our hypothesis, inconsistency in the timing of cognitive processes, reflected by increased IIV in RTs, degrades learning different aspects of language, and results in individual differences in language abilities. Future studies should further examine the relationship between IIV and language abilities, and test the extent to which the possible relationship is causal.\nPMID:\n38913843\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00527",

The study aims to test the validity of the Palestinian Arabic Communicative Development Inventory (PA-CDI) as well as generate growth curves for lexical and morphosyntactic development, examine the order of emergence of both lexical and morphosyntactic categories, and explore the contribution of demographic and developmental factors to language development.\nMETHOD: Data were collected from 1,399 parents of PA children aged 18-36 months using an online PA-CDI.\nRESULTS: The results show that as age increased, so did lexical and morphosyntactic production, along with considerable variability across individuals. While lexical development in PA resembles the order observed in other languages with nouns preceding verbs and adjectives, morphosyntactic development indicates early emergence of verbal inflectional morphology prior to noun pluralization or negation. Age of word combination and health problems are predictive of lexical and morphosyntactic development, and so are parental concerns.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the potential of the PA-CDI as an assessment tool for lexical and morphosyntactic development among PA-speaking children in Israel. Our developmental growth curves may also be used to identify children at risk for developmental language disorder, particularly those falling below the 10th percentile, thus allowing for early identification and early intervention. The use of background variables, specifically parental concerns, health issues, and word combinations, along with the PA-CDI, could potentially enhance the precision of language delay assessment.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26026777.\nPMID:\n38901010\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00606",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: This study evaluated the psychometric functioning of a new criterion-referenced assessment of adolescent social communication, the Transition Pragmatics Interview (TPI), based on the synthesis model of pragmatics. Two ways of interpreting item difficulty were explored: (a) as a function of the synthesis model elements of social communication ability that items were designed to assess, and (b) as a function of the developmental level required for a successful response based on an adapted situational-discourse-semantics (SDS) model (Norris & Hoffman, 1993).\nMETHOD: Thirty-seven participants aged 14-22 years completed the TPI. Responses were analyzed using Rasch analysis to evaluate the functioning of the scale and to determine item difficulty. Items were coded for the SDS developmental level required for an adequate response. The mean Rasch item difficulty for items at each SDS developmental level was analyzed for the five adapted SDS domains.\nRESULTS: Consistent with the first approach for interpreting item difficulty, TPI items varied in difficulty as a function of the element of social communication they were designed to assess (\np\n< .001). Interpreting item difficulty based on the adapted SDS model was not supported: Items requiring higher SDS developmental levels were not more difficult than those requiring less (\np\n= .55).\nCONCLUSIONS: The TPI responses fit the Rasch model, supporting the TPI as a unidimensional measure and supporting the use of all items together to compute a single number that summarizes the level of social communication for each examinee. The item ordering from least to most difficult was consistent with prior findings on adolescent social communication development.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26018545.\nPMID:\n38896882\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00709",

Children completed assessments of oral paragraph reading and word decoding using a vowelized script. They also completed three spoken assessments of Colloquial Arabic, which include sentence comprehension, sentence completion, and pragmatic knowledge, as well as a test of phonological awareness. We used path analysis to investigate the contributions of each of the spoken language indicators, decoding, and phonological awareness to reading comprehension (RC) in single and multiple serial mediator models.\nRESULTS: We found that spoken language (i.e., sentence comprehension, sentence completion, and pragmatic knowledge) and word decoding uniquely contributed to RC. Moreover, word decoding mediated the association between spoken language and RC. The path from spoken language to phonological awareness, then to word decoding, and finally to RC was inconclusive.\nCONCLUSIONS: While most studies on literacy acquisition in the context of Arabic diglossia focus on the linguistic distance between the colloquial (spoken) and the standard (written) language varieties, our results highlight the important contribution of spoken language skills to reading skills in Arabic despite this linguistic gap. The important implication of these findings is that spoken language interventions aimed at boosting children's narrative language skills in their home language (Colloquial Arabic) are an important tool for building a foundation for literacy in diglossia contexts.\nPMID:\n38889224\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00522",

However, poor understanding of the clinical phenotype during childhood has hindered the development of clinical practice guidelines for screening and intervention. Given that social communication difficulties have been widely documented in adults with the FXpm and are linked with reduced psychosocial functioning, the present study aimed to characterize the communication profile of the FXpm during early childhood.\nMETHOD: Eighteen children with the FXpm who were identified through cascade testing (89%) or screening at birth (11%) were compared to 21 matched typically developing children, aged 2-4 years. Participants completed standardized assessments of language (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) and adaptive communication (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II). Social communication was rated from seminaturalistic interaction samples using the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change.\nRESULTS: Children with the FXpm showed delayed social communication development, with the magnitude of group differences highlighting social communication as a feature that distinguishes children with the FXpm from their peers (\np =\n.046, η\np\n2\n= .12). The groups did not differ on the standardized language and adaptive communication measures (\np\ns > .297, η\np\n2\ns < .03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Early screening and treatment of social communication delays may be key to optimizing outcomes for children with the FXpm. Further research is needed to replicate findings in a larger sample, delineate the trajectory and consequences of social communication difficulties across the life span in the FXpm, and determine the potential epidemiological significance of\nFMR1\nas a mediator of developmental communication differences within the general population.\nPMID:\n38889222\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00580",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Caregivers share critical insight during their child's stuttering evaluation; yet, there have been no empirical studies evaluating whether caregivers provide similar accounts of their 3- to 6-year-old child's communication attitude compared to their child's self-report. This study examined caregiver- and child-reported communication attitude and assessed potential moderators of more comparable caregiver and child ratings (i.e., caregiver confidence, caregiver-child conflict, observer-rated stuttering severity).\nMETHOD: One hundred thirteen children who stutter ages 3 through 6 years and a primary caregiver were recruited from clinical settings across the United States. Children completed the Communication Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten Children Who Stutter (KiddyCAT) and three speaking samples, which were recorded to assess observer-rated stuttering severity using the Stuttering Severity Instrument-Fourth Edition. Caregivers predicted their child's communication attitude (C-KiddyCAT) and provided a confidence rating for their prediction. Caregivers also rated caregiver-child conflict using the Child-Parent Relationship Scale-Short Form (CPRS-SF). Multiple regression was used to (a) evaluate whether caregiver C-KiddyCAT scores predicted child KiddyCAT scores and (b) assess potential moderators of the relationship between C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores.\nRESULTS: Caregiver ratings of their child's communication attitude (C-KiddyCAT) predicted child communication attitude ratings (KiddyCAT). A significant interaction between caregiver-child conflict (CPRS-SF) and caregiver ratings of their child's communication attitude (C-KiddyCAT) suggested caregiver-child conflict changed the underlying relationship between C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores, such that low conflict resulted in more similar C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores. Neither caregiver confidence nor observer-rated stuttering severity influenced the relationship between C-KiddyCAT and KiddyCAT scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although many caregivers predicted communication attitude ratings that closely aligned with their child's report, some caregiver-child dyads provided divergent ratings. Clinicians should interpret caregiver predictions of their child's communication attitude within the context of their full evaluation and the caregiver-child relationship. Assessing both self-reported communication attitude and caregiver predictions of their child's communication attitude provides a meaningful starting point to counseling caregivers about cognitive components of stuttering for preschool- and kindergarten-age children who stutter.\nPMID:\n38889195\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00662",

The purpose was to determine whether CLAN's FLUCALC command could produce efficient, objective outcome measures for salient aspects of fluency in aphasia.\nMETHOD: The FLUCALC command was used on CHAT transcripts of Cinderella stories from people with aphasia (PWA;\nn\n= 281) and controls (\nn\n= 257) in the AphasiaBank database.\nRESULTS: PWA produced significantly fewer total words, fewer words per minute, more pausing, more repetitions, more revisions, and more phonological fragments than controls, with only one exception: The Wernicke's group was similar to the control group in percentage of filled pauses. Individuals with Broca's aphasia had significantly longer inter-utterance pauses and fewer total words than all other aphasia groups. Both the Broca's and conduction aphasia groups had higher percentages of phrase repetitions than the NABW (NotAphasicByWAB) group. The conduction aphasia group also had a higher percentage of phrase revisions than the NABW and the anomic aphasia groups. Principal components analysis revealed two principal components that accounted for around 60% of the variance and related to quantity of output, rate of speech, and quality of output. The Gaussian mixture models showed that the participants clustered in three groups, which corresponded predominantly to the controls, the nonfluent aphasia group, and the remaining aphasia groups (all classically fluent aphasia types).\nCONCLUSIONS: FLUCALC is an efficient way to measure objective fluency behaviors in language samples in aphasia. Automated analyses of objective fluency behaviors on large samples of adults with and without aphasia can produce measures that can be used by researchers and clinicians to better understand and track salient aspects of fluency in aphasia.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25979863.\nPMID:\n38875483\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00659",

Risk factors that predicted PNIHL in the analyzed cohort were as follows: syndromes associated with hearing loss, craniofacial anomalies, perinatal infections, and family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. Severe asphyxia did not predict PNIHL but yielded some cases of significant bilateral hearing loss. Hearing loss in children with a history of prolonged ventilation was mild and/or unilateral in nature (except in cases where the hearing loss was due to an unrelated etiology). There were no cases of PNIHL in children with hyperbilirubinemia or neonatal bacterial meningitis. For the risk factors that predicted PNIHL, nearly all hearing losses were detected by 1 year of age, except for children with family history where one quarter of hearing losses had a later onset.\nCONCLUSIONS: The four risk factors recommended for efficient postnatal identification of hearing loss are as follows: syndromes associated with hearing loss, craniofacial anomalies, perinatal infection, and family history of permanent childhood hearing loss. Hearing surveillance through to 1 year old is sufficient except for children with a family history, where a second phase assessment is indicated.

English and Chinese studies published until April 2024 were searched using 31 electronic databases, and seven studies were included. The included articles were assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations rubric.\nRESULTS: Seven studies were included. These studies reported outcome measures that were related to respiratory functions only. For the intervention effect, statistically significant improvements were observed in five of the included studies, among which three studies had large effect sizes. The overall level of evidence of the included studies was not high, with three studies having moderate levels and the rest having lower levels. The intervention activities included trainings other than singing. These non-singing training items may have caused co-intervention bias in the study results.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that singing as an intervention for older adults with respiratory and cognitive problems could improve respiration and respiratory-phonatory control. However, none of the included studies covers the other two of the physical functions related to aging voice (phonatory and postural functions). The overall level of evidence of the included studies was not high either.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: The vocal fold tissues undergo nearly continuous and repeated cycles of injury and repair throughout the course of an individual's lifetime. It is well established that certain individuals are at greater risk of lesion development based on personality and behavioral classification. However, these characteristics alone do not wholly predict or explain lesion development or severity. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of mechanotransduction proteins and their potential relevance to tissue homeostasis in the vocal folds.\nMETHOD: A review of literature surrounding mechanotransduction and tissue homeostasis as it relates to the vocal folds was conducted. Review of the literature included searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, and other various online peer-reviewed sources. Search terms pertained to mechanosensation, mechanotransduction, mechanically activated channels, mechanical cellular regulation, and other associated concepts and terms. Additional literature was identified through the reference lists of identified papers. Findings of this literature review were then applied to known physiology and pathophysiology of the vocal folds in order to speculate on the contribution of mechanically mediated mechanisms within the vocal fold.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Because the vocal folds are such mechanically active structures, withstanding nearly constant external forces, there is strong support for the idea that mechanically sensitive molecular pathways within the vocal fold tissue play a major role in tissue homeostasis in the presence of these considerable forces. As such, mechanotransduction within the vocal fold should be considered and targeted in future biological studies of vocal fold physiology.\nPMID:\n38865255\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00718",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Although different factors and voice measures have been associated with phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH), it is unclear what percentage of individuals with PVH exhibit such differences during their daily lives. This study used a machine learning approach to quantify the consistency with which PVH manifests according to ambulatory voice measures. Analyses included acoustic parameters of phonation as well as temporal aspects of phonation and rest, with the goal of determining optimally consistent signatures of PVH.\nMETHOD: Ambulatory neck-surface acceleration signals were recorded over 1 week from 116 female participants diagnosed with PVH and age-, sex-, and occupation-matched vocally healthy controls. The consistency of the manifestation of PVH was defined as the percentage of participants in each group that exhibited an atypical signature based on a target voice measure. Evaluation of each machine learning model used nested 10-fold cross-validation to improve the generalizability of findings. In Experiment 1, we trained separate logistic regression models based on the distributional characteristics of 14 voice measures and durations of voicing and resting segments. In Experiments 2 and 3, features of voicing and resting duration augmented the existing distributional characteristics to examine whether more consistent signatures would result.\nRESULTS: Experiment 1 showed that the difference in the magnitude of the first two harmonics (H1-H2) exhibited the most consistent signature (69.4% of participants with PVH and 20.4% of controls had an atypical H1-H2 signature), followed by spectral tilt over eight harmonics (73.6% participants with PVH and 32.1% of controls had an atypical spectral tilt signature) and estimated sound pressure level (SPL; 66.9% participants with PVH and 27.6% of controls had an atypical SPL signature). Additionally, 77.6% of participants with PVH had atypical resting duration, with 68.9% exhibiting atypical voicing duration. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that augmenting the best-performing voice measures with univariate features of voicing or resting durations yielded only incremental improvement in the classifier's performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Females with PVH were more likely to use more abrupt vocal fold closure (lower H1-H2), phonate louder (higher SPL), and take shorter vocal rests. They were also less likely to use higher fundamental frequency during their daily activities. The difference in the voicing duration signature between participants with PVH and controls had a large effect size, providing strong empirical evidence regarding the role of voice use in the development of PVH.\nPMID:\n38861454\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00515",

In this research note, we report feasibility and preliminary data from a new conversation memory study protocol.\nMETHOD: Participants in this feasibility study were 10 pairs, each including an adult with chronic, moderate-to-severe TBI and their chosen familiar conversation partner. The experiment began with a naturalistic conversation between participants with TBI and their conversation partners. After a filled delay, participants next completed verbal recall for the conversation, which we transcribed and coded for their accuracy relative to the original conversation. Participants also read chosen statements from their original conversation and predicted what each partner would remember in a week. One week later, participants completed a posttest about who said each of the chosen statements, allowing direct comparison to their predictions.\nRESULTS: We successfully collected conversation memory data from all 10 pairs, suggesting that this protocol is feasible for future study. In this preliminary sample, people with TBI and their conversation partners did not differ in the accuracy of their recall for the conversation about 20 min after it occurred. When asked to predict their partner's delayed memory, conversation partners were less accurate than participants with TBI because they underestimated how much their partners with TBI would remember.\nCONCLUSION: Measuring memory for conversation in TBI is feasible and may advance the characterization of cognitive-communication impairment in TBI, and its heterogeneity, in everyday contexts.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25927513.\nPMID:\n38861453\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00420",

MV was defined as producing fewer than 20 spontaneous, unique, and socially communicative words. Autism symptom severity (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition) and nonverbal cognitive skills (Leiter-R Brief IQ) were assessed at entry. A natural language sample (NLS), a 20-min examiner-child interaction with specified toys, was collected at entry (Week 1) and exit (Week 18) from JASPER + EMT intervention. The NLS was coded for gestures (deictic, conventional, and representational) and gesture-speech combinations (reinforcing, disambiguating, supplementary, other) at entry and spoken language outcomes: speech quantity (rate of speech utterances) and speech quality (number of different words [NDW] and mean length of utterance in words [MLUw]) at exit using European Distributed Corpora Project Linguistic Annotator and Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts.\nRESULTS: Controlling for nonverbal IQ and autism symptom severity at entry, rate of gesture-speech combinations (but not gestures alone) at entry was a significant predictor of rate of speech utterances and MLUw at exit. The rate of supplementary gesture-speech combinations, in particular, significantly predicted rate of speech utterances and NDW at exit.\nCONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical importance of gestural communication, particularly gesture-speech (supplementary) combinations in supporting spoken language development in MV autistic children.\nPMID:\n38861424\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_JSLHR-23-00433",

This qualitative study describes the experiences of families of first- and second-grade children with DLD during the pandemic as compared to the experiences of families of typically developing (TD) peers.\nMETHOD: A conventional content analysis approach was used to analyze caregivers' written responses to open-ended questions regarding their perceptions of COVID-19 educational disruptions. Responses were analyzed separately by group: caregivers of children with DLD (\nn\n= 23) and caregivers of TD children (\nn\n= 22).\nRESULTS: Four categories of caregiver responses were generated for each group: impacts on children, remote learning challenges, impacts on caregivers, and protective factors. For both groups, concerns about the child's well-being and literacy learning were most prevalent and prevailed over concerns about oral language. Most caregivers in each group described negative impacts of educational disruptions on their cdhildren. As compared to caregivers of TD children, caregivers of children with DLD reported higher rates of remote learning challenges and more negative impacts on literacy learning, speech and/or language, and education in general. DLD caregivers also shared fewer positive comments and remarks related to protective factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that families of children with DLD may have experienced more challenges during COVID-19 educational disruptions as compared to families of TD peers. Thus, responsive research and supports for these families is essential.\nPMID:\n39028568\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00181",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit auditory processing issues, including poor speech recognition in background noise and dichotic processing (integration of different stimuli presented to the two ears). Auditory training could mitigate these auditory difficulties. However, few auditory training programs have been designed to target specific listening deficits for students with ASD. The present study summarizes the development of an innovative, one-on-one, clinician-developed speech-in-noise (SIN) training program that has not been previously described and an existing dichotic auditory training program to address common auditory processing deficits in students with ASD.\nMETHOD: Twenty verbal students with ASD, ages 7-17 years, completed a one-on-one, clinician-developed SIN training program and a commercially available dichotic training program 2-3 times a week (30-45 min per session) for 12 weeks. Maximum and minimum training levels from the SIN and dichotic training programs were analyzed statistically to document changes in training level over the training period.\nRESULTS: Analyses of the pre- and posttraining data revealed significant improvements in training level for both the SIN and dichotic training programs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the proposed SIN training resulted in significant improvements in training level and may be used along with dichotic training to improve some of the most common auditory processing issues documented in verbal individuals with ASD requiring minimal support. Both types of auditory training may be implemented in one-on-one therapy in clinics and in the schools.\nPMID:\n39008496\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00168",

Narratives were elicited in SL/Hebrew using the wordless picture book,\nFrog, Where Are You?\nNarratives were transcribed and coded for frequency of ISTs and classified as perceptual, linguistic, motivational, linguistic, emotional, or physical. ISTs were also examined in terms of their role in microstructure (tokens and types) and macrostructure (Character, Setting, Initiating Event, Internal Response, Plan, Attempt, and Consequence) categories.\nRESULTS: In terms of microstructure, bilingual children with DLD produced fewer word types and tokens in general and fewer perceptual ISTs than bilingual TLD peers. In terms of macrostructure, children with DLD used six out of the seven story grammar elements in their narratives less than bilinguals with TLD. For ISTs and macrostructure, bilinguals with DLD produced fewer linguistic ISTs in Attempts than their peers with TLD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bilingual children with DLD have difficulties in producing ISTs, and this difficulty is shown to be related to both microstructure and macrostructure abilities.

Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and promise of a writing intervention for fourth- and fifth-grade students with LLD (WILLD: writing in students with LLD). The intervention components included word-, sentence-, and discourse-level writing processes and instructional practices using self-regulation strategies.\nMETHOD: Participants for this study were 15 students with LLD, recruited from three different schools. Students' writing was assessed using a sentence probe task and obtaining an informative paragraph writing sample as a measure of proximal writing outcomes.

Treatment was carried out over 12 sessions with approximately two sessions per week. Maintenance sessions were conducted 1, 2, and 4 weeks postintervention. Participants were explicitly taught story grammar elements, causal and temporal connections, and modifiers within story retells and personal narratives. Dependent variables were story grammar, grammatical complexity, modifiers and listening comprehension within story retells, and story grammar and grammatical complexity within personal narratives. Outcome measures were assessed at the end of every baseline, intervention, and maintenance session using the Narrative Language Measures-Listening (NLM-L).\nRESULTS: Visual analyses for outcome measures suggested slight increases in scores on the NLM-L during intervention accompanied by marked variability.

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nPURPOSE: We investigated the effectiveness of a highly individualized morphosyntactic intervention using the SHAPE CODING™ system delivered at different dosages.\nMETHOD: Eight children with developmental language disorder aged 8;0-10;10 (years;months) received 10 hr of explicit individualized intervention for morphosyntax delivered in 30-min individual sessions once per week for 20 weeks. Following at least four baseline probe tests, two grammatical targets per session received explicit instruction until they reached criterion (90%), when the next target was introduced. To control for session length and teaching episode density, either both targets received 20 teaching episodes per session or one target received 10 teaching episodes and the other 30. Maintenance testing of completed targets was also carried out.\nRESULTS: Scores on probe tests post-intervention were significantly higher than during the baseline phase (\nd\n= 1.6) with no change during the baseline or maintenance phases. However, progress during the intervention phase was highly significant. One participant showed significantly faster progress with intervention, while one (with the lowest attention score) made little progress. When considering progress relative to cumulative intervention sessions, progress was faster with 30 teaching episodes per session and slower with 10. However, when cumulative teaching episodes were used as the predictor, all three within-session dosages showed very similar rates of progress, with the odds of a correct response increasing by 3.9% for each teaching episode. The targets that were achieved required an average of 40-60 teaching episodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the exception of one participant, the individualized intervention was highly effective and efficient. Thus, the individualized target identification process and intervention method merit further research in a larger group of children. The cumulative number of teaching episodes per target provided across sessions appeared to be key. Thus, clinicians should aim for high teaching episode rates, particularly if the number of sessions is constrained. Otherwise, intervention scheduling can be flexible.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25996168.\nPMID:\n38896880\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00098",

We (a) described preschoolers' performance on the CELFP-2 Core Language Index (CLI) and its subtests with consideration of degree of dialect variation (DVAR) observed, (b) investigated how the application of dialect-sensitive scoring modifications to the expressive morphology and syntax Word Structure (WS) subtest affected CELFP-2 CLI scores, and (c) evaluated the screening classification agreement rates between the DELV-ST and the CELFP-2 CLI.\nMETHOD: African American preschoolers (\nN\n= 284) completed the CELFP-2 CLI subtests (i.e., Sentence Structure, WS, Expressive Vocabulary) and the DELV-ST. Density of spoken dialect use was estimated with the DELV-ST Part I Language Variation Status, and percentage of DVAR was calculated. The CELFP-2 WS subtest was scored with and without dialect-sensitive scoring modifications.\nRESULTS: Planned comparisons of CELFP-2 CLI performance indicated statistically significant differences in performance based on DELV-ST-determined degree of language variation groupings. Scoring modifications applied to the WS subtest increased subtest scaled scores and CLI composite standard scores. However, preschoolers who demonstrated strong variation from GAE continued to demonstrate significantly lower performance than preschoolers who demonstrated little to no language variation. Affected-status agreement rates between assessments (modified and unmodified CELFP-2 CLI scores and DELV-ST Part II Diagnostic Risk Status) were extremely low.\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of dialect-specific scoring modifications to standardized, norm-referenced assessments of language must be simultaneously viewed through the lenses of equity, practicality, and psychometry. The results of our multistage study reiterate the need for reliable methods of identifying risk for developmental language disorder within children who speak American English dialects other than GAE.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.26017978.\nPMID:\n38889198\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00134",

Growth curve models captured within- and between-individual change in article accuracy from the beginning of preschool to the end of first grade.\nRESULTS: As a group, DLLs did not exhibit significant positive or negative growth in Spanish article accuracy over time. On average, article accuracy remained stable at 76% from preschool throughout first grade. Participants exhibited significant variability in article accuracy that was partly explained by changes in Spanish proficiency. Spanish article accuracy was lower for DLLs with lower Spanish proficiency indexed by measures from the Spanish language samples, while English proficiency indexed by the English language samples did not affect Spanish article accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that expectations for Spanish grammatical performance in DLLs need to be adjusted to account for the possible impact of not receiving Spanish support in English immersion school settings. DLLs in these instructional programs do not exhibit article accuracy at a level expected for monolingual Spanish speakers. Significant individual differences in both individual status and growth rates of Spanish article accuracy highlight the broad variability in Spanish language skills of DLLs in the United States.\nPMID:\n38843435\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00202",

Reduced shared reading has been documented among families of caregiver(s) with language-based learning disabilities (LBLD). Yet, it remains unclear whether caregivers' history of language and reading difficulties is associated with caregiver self-efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine whether self-efficacy in language- and reading-related caregiver activities related to caregiver history of language and reading difficulties and shared reading practices.\nMETHOD: One hundred seventy-six caregivers of children aged 18-60 months completed a custom self-efficacy in language- and reading-related caregiver activities questionnaire, as well as demographic, history of language and reading difficulties (used both as a continuous measure and to dichotomize caregivers with and without LBLD history), and shared reading measures in a one-time survey.\nRESULTS: Caregivers with a history of LBLD reported an overall lower self-efficacy and a reduced amount of time reading with their children per week than caregivers without LBLD history. Examining caregiver history of language and reading difficulties continuously across the whole group, self-efficacy mediated the relationship between caregiver difficulties and shared reading practices, even when caregiver education was incorporated as an additional mediator in models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that self-efficacy and caregiver education mediate the relationship between caregiver history of language and reading difficulties and shared reading practices. Consideration of self-efficacy by clinicians and educators is warranted when promoting shared reading practices to caregivers of young children. There is a need for future research to examine relationships between self-efficacy and shared reading among caregivers with LBLD of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25901590.\nPMID:\n38820226\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00067",

These articles were subjected to rigorous evaluation for inclusion criteria, specifically focusing on their reporting of speech or auditory perception using psychoacoustic tasks. The selected studies exclusively examined school-age children, encompassing those between 5 and 18 years of age. Following rigorous evaluation, 10 articles meeting these criteria were selected for inclusion in the review.\nRESULTS: The analysis of included articles consistently shows that even slight hearing loss in school-age children significantly affects their speech and auditory perception. Notably, most of the included articles highlighted a common trend, demonstrating that perceptual deficits originating due to slight hearing loss in children are particularly observable under challenging experimental conditions and/or in cognitively demanding listening tasks. Recent evidence further underscores that the negative impacts of slight hearing loss in school-age children cannot be solely predicted by their pure-tone thresholds alone. However, there is limited evidence concerning the effect of slight hearing loss on the segregation of competing speech, which may be a better representation of listening in the classroom.\nCONCLUSION: This scoping review discusses the perceptual consequences of slight hearing loss in school-age children and provides insights into an array of methodological issues associated with studying perceptual skills in school-age children with slight hearing losses, offering guidance for future research endeavors.\nPMID:\n38787321\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00165",

Some transcribe these clauses as two separate utterances, whereas others conjoin them within a single utterance. As an inquiry into equitable practice, we examined rates of conjoined independent clauses produced by children and the impact of separating these clauses within utterances on measures of mean length of utterance (MLU) by a child's English dialect, clinical status, and age.\nMETHOD: The data were archival and included 246 language samples from children classified by their dialect (African American English or Southern White English) and clinical status (developmental language disorder [DLD] or typically developing [TD]), with those in the TD group further classified by their age (4 years [TD4] or 6 years [TD6]).\nRESULTS: Rates of conjoined independent clauses and the impact of these clauses on MLU varied by clinical status (DLD < TD) and age (TD4 < TD6), but not by dialect. Correlations between the rate of conjoined clauses, MLU, and language test scores were also similar across the two dialects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Transcription decisions regarding conjoined independent clauses within language samples lead to equitable measurement outcomes across dialects of English.

Participants included 273 English-speaking kindergarten through second-grade children with language impairment receiving business-as-usual therapy on the caseloads of 75 speech-language pathologists. Data were collected over an academic year, including weekly therapy logs, speech-language pathology questionnaires, and pre- and post-language measures.\nRESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed that children primarily experienced small-group therapy sessions (two to four children); however, there was considerable variability in group size. Hierarchical general linear modeling indicated that caseload size did not explain group size variability. However, the number of student cancellations was positively associated with receipt of large-group sessions. Notably, a significant negative association was found between receipt of large-group sessions (i.e., five to 10 children) and language outcomes. Children who received more than the average number of sessions in large groups (i.e., more than 5% of total sessions) experienced 0.18\nSD\nless language gain over the academic year compared to the mean (0.54\nSD\n). No other group size configurations (i.e., individual, small group, and extra large) yielded significant associations with language outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that young children receiving language-based therapy in large groups make substantially fewer language gains over an academic year. These results have considerable implications for educational policy and clinical practice, which are discussed through an implementation science frame.\nPMID:\n38748997\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00047",

Discourse elicitation and analysis provides the opportunity for such an evaluation to occur. In this article, our overall aim was to describe adolescents' language performance on four elicitation tasks and determine if there are task-related differences across the elicitation tasks.\nMETHOD: Forty-four typically developing adolescents with ages ranging from 12;2 to 17;11 (years;months;\nM =\n15;2; 21 boys and 23 girls) participated in the study. They completed four spoken discourse tasks: (a) story generation using a wordless picture book, (b) fable retell, (c) six personal narratives in response to emotion-based prompts, and (d) monologic response to two stories that contained a moral dilemma. Responses were transcribed and analyzed for four language performance measures tapping into language productivity, syntactic complexity, lexical diversity, and verbal facility.\nRESULTS: Despite individual variability in performance, mean scores were close to median scores for most measures, suggesting a symmetrical distribution. As expected, all four language performance measures were significantly different across the four elicitation tasks. The personal narrative task elicited the longest samples, with the highest verbal fluency. In contrast, both lexical diversity and syntactic complexity were the strongest in response to the fable retell and the moral dilemma tasks.\nCONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides speech-language pathologists with an overview of how task-related factors may impact adolescent language performance. These findings may be used to support their clinical decision-making processes in choosing a suitable discourse task when conducting a comprehensive spoken language assessment. Three hypothetical case examples are used to illustrate the decision-making process.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25761768.\nPMID:\n38748925\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00163",

There is, however, a lack of consensus on (a) how to train educators to deliver the intervention and (b) methods for assessing implementation fidelity. We designed this study to provide preliminary data about the viability of online video modules as an initial training option within a future tiered training model.\nMETHOD: We employed a within-subject repeated-measures group design to evaluate educators' (\nN\n= 20) implementation of DR after viewing training videos. Educators filmed themselves reading three storybooks with a child \"as they would typically\" to establish pretest reading behaviors. After being given access to a series of DR training videos, the educators recorded themselves reading three storybooks with the child using DR strategies as a posttest measure.\nRESULTS: Educators improved their use of individual strategies included in the DR instructional sequence at posttest; however, most participants did not consistently follow the entire instructional sequence as designed. Only one educator delivered the complete DR instructional sequence in > 80% of opportunities at posttest.\nCONCLUSION: Modifications to video training modules and additional coaching support may be warranted for many educators to achieve the level of implementation fidelity needed to improve the child's oral language skills from the intervention.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.25749387.\nPMID:\n38718252\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00109",

The purpose of this study was to understand implicit racial and ethnic bias in speech-language pathology students by examining their perceptions and attitudes about the acceptability of racial and ethnic microaggressions. We also examined whether the student ratings varied by their racial and ethnic identity (White vs. people of color [POC]).\nMETHOD: Fifty-nine students (72% White, 28% POC) currently enrolled in a speech-language pathology program voluntarily completed the Acceptability of Racial Microaggressions Scale via an online Qualtrics survey.\nRESULTS: Although 70% of the student ratings classified the microaggressive statements as unacceptable, 30% of their ratings classified the statements as either (a) acceptable or (b) neither acceptable nor unacceptable. Although both groups of students rated the majority of statements as unacceptable, students who self-identified as White rated more statements as acceptable than students who self-identified as POC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings indicating relatively high rejection of microaggressive statements by speech-language pathology students are promising. However, responses were not uniform, and a nontrivial proportion of responses provided by speech-language pathology students reflected passivity toward or active endorsement of microaggressive statements.\nPMID:\n38701432\n| DOI:\n10.1044/2024_LSHSS-23-00106",

The mechanisms underlying this association are not yet fully understood, especially in individuals without a known specific otologic disorder. In particular, only scarce information on the combined occurrence of audiovestibular sensory impairment is available so far. Therefore, this study aims to provide further insight into the prevalence and co-prevalence of the audiovestibular symptoms hearing loss, tinnitus and dizziness. Additionally, the influence of potential risk factors from lifestyle habits as well as cardiovascular and metabolic conditions on the development of those symptoms is studied. Data was analyzed from 8134 individuals from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). SHIP pursues a broad and comprehensive examination program in chronologically separated cohorts with longitudinal follow-up. Cohorts are sampled from Western Pomerania, a rural region of north-eastern Germany. The study population represents a cross-sectional analysis from the cohorts SHIP-START (recruited 1997-2001) and SHIP-TREND (recruited 2008-2012), sampled for baseline investigations (SHIP-START-0 and SHIP-TREND-0) at the age of 20-79 years. Audiovestibular symptoms as outcome variables were assessed by structured questionnaires. Additionally, individuals were comprehensively characterized regarding modifiable lifestyle factors as well as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, allowing the assessment of their role as exposure variables. We calculated a weighted prevalence of 14.2% for hearing loss, 9.7% for tinnitus, and 13.5% for dizziness in the population. Prevalence increased with age and differed among the sexes. A considerable share of 28.0% of the investigated individuals reported more than one symptom at once. The prevalence of hearing loss as well as tinnitus increased between the two cohorts. A moderate positive correlation was found between the occurrence of hearing loss and tinnitus (phi-coefficient 0.318). In multivariable regression analyses, education was identified as a significant protective factor while only smoking was significantly associated with all three symptoms. Furthermore, several cardiovascular risk factors contributed to both hearing loss and dizziness. In conclusion, audiovestibular symptoms are highly prevalent in the investigated population. A considerable but complex influence of risk factors points towards a relation with neuronal as well as cardiovascular disease processes. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, the interaction between the senses of hearing and balance as well as the mode of action of the risk factors should be evaluated in more detail in the future.\nPMID:\n39085387\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-68577-3",

To overcome the artifact caused by the internal device in post-CI scan, image reconstruction method was newly devised and applied using the contralateral hemisphere of the pre-CI MRI data, to run FreeSurfer. We conducted within-subject template estimation for unbiased longitudinal image analysis, based on the linear mixed effect models. When analyzing the contralateral cerebral hemisphere before and after CI, a substantial increase in superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus (STG) volumes was observed in the left CI group. A positive correlation was observed in the STG and post-CI word recognition score in both groups. As far as we know, this is the first study attempting longitudinal brain volumetry based on post-CI MRI scans.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 40 chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis with hearing impairment. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. One group received curcumin daily and the other received a placebo for 12 weeks. The interval between III and V waves, latency of wave V, auditory brain stem response (ABR) threshold, speech reception threshold (SRT), and speech discrimination score (SDS) were evaluated and analyzed before and after the intervention. After treatment, in the curcumin group, III-V waves interval and the latency of wave V were significantly reduced (P value < 0.0001), also ABR threshold was demonstrated a significant improvement (P value < 0.0001). In the trial group, the SDS was increased (P = 0.001) and the SRT was attenuated (P < 0.0001). We had either significant deterioration due to the course of the disease or insignificant changes in the placebo group.

Considering the continued perpetration and visibility of racism online and in the news, vicarious racism, or \"secondhand\" racism when hearing about or witnessing racism being committed against members of one's ethnic or racial group, is a particularly urgent threat in the context of such disparities and their subsequent health consequences. The current study examines if frequency of exposure to vicarious racism and the emotional impact of those experiences are linked to psychoactive substance use, and explores the role of ethnic identity in moderating these relationships. In a cross-sectional survey, 504 adult participants aged 18-78 (M age = 30.15, SD = 11.52, 52.6% female) identifying as Black/African American or Latine reported on their experiences with vicarious racism and alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use over the past 30 days. Logistic regression was utilized to test hypotheses. Primary findings indicate that greater emotional impact of vicarious racism was associated with a 50% increase in odds of alcohol consumption and that ethnic identity moderated the association between vicarious racism and marijuana use. Greater emotional impact of vicarious racism was related to more marijuana use for those lower on ethnic identity, whereas there was no association for those higher on ethnic identity. Vicarious racism was not related to tobacco use. Results suggest that ethnic identity might be protective in the association of vicarious racism on substance use. Further research on this topic is needed as vicarious racism becomes an increasingly common experience among marginalized populations.\nPMID:\n39060300\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-67202-7",

We recovered original footage of two enculturated chimpanzees uttering the word \"mama\" and subjected recordings to phonetic analysis. Our analyses demonstrate that chimpanzees are capable of syllabic production, achieving consonant-to-vowel phonetic contrasts via the simultaneous recruitment and coupling of voice, jaw and lips. In an online experiment, human listeners naive to the recordings' origins reliably perceived chimpanzee utterances as syllabic utterances, primarily as \"ma-ma\", among foil syllables. Our findings demonstrate that in the absence of direct data-driven examination, great ape vocal production capacities have been underestimated. Chimpanzees possess the neural building blocks necessary for speech.\nPMID:\n39054330\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-67005-w",

For deaf signers who experience changes in visual attention and have little or no access to the sounds of the language they read, understanding the visual constraints underlying reading is crucial. This study aims to explore a fundamental aspect of visual perception intertwined with reading: the crowding effect. This effect manifests as the struggle to distinguish a target letter when surrounded by flanker letters. Through a two-alternative forced choice task, we assessed the recognition of letters and symbols presented in isolation or flanked by two or four characters, positioned either to the left or right of fixation. Our findings reveal that while deaf individuals exhibit higher accuracy in processing letters compared to symbols, their performance falls short of that of their hearing counterparts. Interestingly, despite their proficiency with letters, deaf individuals didn't demonstrate quicker letter identification, particularly in the most challenging scenario where letters were flanked by four characters. These outcomes imply the development of a specialized letter processing system among deaf individuals, albeit one that may subtly diverge from that of their hearing counterparts.\nPMID:\n38997432\n| PMC:\nPMC11245469\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66832-1",

Inner hair cells act as primary mechanoelectrical transducers, while outer hair cells enhance sound-induced vibrations within the organ of Corti. Established inner ear damage models, such as systemic administration of ototoxic aminoglycosides, yield inconsistent and variable hair cell death in mice. Overcoming this limitation, we developed a method involving surgical delivery of a hyperosmotic sisomicin solution into the posterior semicircular canal of adult mice. This procedure induced rapid and synchronous apoptotic demise of outer hair cells within 14 h, leading to irreversible hearing loss. The combination of sisomicin and hyperosmotic stress caused consistent and synergistic ototoxic damage. Inner hair cells remained until three days post-treatment, after which deterioration in structure and number was observed, culminating in a complete hair cell loss by day seven.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the health of older adults. However, less is known about the characteristics of ED visits by older adults with HD during the pandemic. This study examines the association between self-reported HD severity and ED visits during the pandemic. This population-based cross-sectional study used self-reported data on HD and the characteristics of respondents aged 65 years or older from three cycles of the National Health Interview Survey from 2020 to 2022. Data were analysed from February 23, 2023, to March 22, 2023. The primary outcome was self-reported ED visits in the past 12 months. This study employed generalised linear models to examine the relationship between ED visits (dependent variable) and HD in older adults, and the effect sizes were expressed as rate ratios. Key independent variables included the reasons for ED visit. Covariates such as demographic characteristics and socio-economic status were controlled for to account for potential confounding effects. During the pandemic, older adults with HD commonly visited the ED because of chronic pain (82.8%), frailty (77.9%), trouble falling/staying asleep (73.2%), hypertension (67.4%), and arthritis (60.1%), all of which were 1.5-times more likely in these adults than in those with normal hearing (chronic pain: adjusted rate ratio [ARR], 1.64 [95% CI 1.44-1.93]; frailty: ARR, 1.57 [95% CI 1.16-1.87]; trouble falling/staying asleep: ARR, 1.51 [95% CI 1.21-1.82]; hypertension: ARR, 1.01 [95% CI 0.92-1.23]; arthritis: ARR, 1.39 [95% CI 1.31-1.57]. Older adults with HD were more likely to visit the ED for chronic pain, frailty, trouble falling/staying asleep, hypertension, and arthritis than those with normal hearing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to explore the impact of age-related hearing loss in the extended high frequency (EHF) range above 8 kHz on individuals' subjective discomfort towards dental drill noise. After measuring pure-tone audiometric thresholds at both conventional and extended high frequencies, we used a psychoacoustic approach to evaluate subjective impressions of four dental drill sound stimuli, which featured varying frequency components, in 62 participants (aged 12-67 years). We found a significant decrease in hearing sensitivity within the EHF range as age increased, with notable differences in hearing thresholds at 14 kHz between teenage and older adults exceeding 65 dB. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between younger and older (above 40 years) participants in the subjective impressions of dental drill noise, emphasizing age as a critical factor in the perception of high frequency components. Consequently, age may influence the unpleasantness of dental drilling noise. Compared to older individuals, young participants may exhibit increased fear of dental procedures owing to physiological factors. These results underscore the need for age-appropriate noise control strategies in dental clinics to mitigate anxiety and improve patient comfort.\nPMID:\n38977724\n| PMC:\nPMC11231262\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-65429-y",

To investigate these questions, we constructed predictive and correlational models, which utilize mean surprisals from LLMs as predictor variables. Using AphasiaBank archived data, we validated our models' efficacy in aphasia diagnosis, measurement, and prediction. Our finding is that LLMs-surprisals can effectively detect the presence of aphasia and different natures of the disorder, LLMs in conjunction with the existing language indices improve models' efficacy in subtyping aphasia, and LLMs-surprisals can capture common agrammatic deficits at both word and sentence level.

We previously reported that HK-2, an orally active, multifunctional redox modulator (MFRM), was highly effective in reducing both hearing loss and hair cells loss in rats exposed to a moderate intensity workday noise that likely damages the cochlea primarily from oxidative stress versus direct mechanical trauma. To determine if HK-2 could also protect cochlear and vestibular cells from damage caused primarily from direct blast-induced mechanical trauma versus oxidative stress, we exposed rats to six blasts of 186 dB peak SPL. The rats were divided into four groups: (B) blast alone, (BEP) blast plus earplugs, (BHK-2) blast plus HK-2 and (BEPHK-2) blast plus earplugs plus HK-2. HK-2 was orally administered at 50 mg/kg/d from 7-days before to 30-day after the blast exposure. Cochlear and vestibular tissues were harvested 60-d post-exposure and evaluated for loss of outer hair cells (OHC), inner hair cells (IHC), auditory nerve fibers (ANF), spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and vestibular hair cells in the saccule, utricle and semicircular canals. In the untreated blast-exposed group (B), massive losses occurred to OHC, IHC, ANF, SGN and only the vestibular hair cells in the striola region of the saccule. In contrast, rats treated with HK-2 (BHK-2) sustained significantly less OHC (67%) and IHC (57%) loss compared to the B group. OHC and IHC losses were smallest in the BEPHK-2 group, but not significantly different from the BEP group indicating lack of protective synergy between EP and HK-2. There was no loss of ANF, SGN or saccular hair cells in the BHK-2, BEP and BEPHK-2 groups. Thus, HK-2 not only significantly reduced OHC and IHC damage, but completely prevented loss of ANF, SGN and saccule hair cells. The powerful protective effects of this oral MFRM make HK-2 an extremely promising candidate for human clinical trials.\nPMID:\n38961203\n| PMC:\nPMC11222375\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-66406-1",

Currently the detection of the m.1555A > G variant of the MT-RNR1 gene is not included in all research protocols. In this study this variant was screened among 165 patients with HL from the Republic of Buryatia, located in the Baikal Lake region of Russia. In our study, the total contribution of the m.1555A > G variant to the etiology of HL was 12.7% (21/165), while the update global prevalence of this variant is 1.8% (863/47,328).

A tactile vocoder strategy for audio-to-tactile conversion, which exploits these advances, has recently shown significant promise. In this strategy, the amplitude envelope is extracted from several audio frequency bands and used to modulate the amplitude of a set of vibro-tactile tones. The vocoder strategy allows good consonant discrimination, but vowel discrimination is poor and the strategy is susceptible to background noise. In the current study, we assessed whether multi-band amplitude envelope expansion can effectively enhance critical vowel features, such as formants, and improve speech extraction from noise. In 32 participants with normal touch perception, tactile-only phoneme discrimination with and without envelope expansion was assessed both in quiet and in background noise. Envelope expansion improved performance in quiet by 10.3% for vowels and by 5.9% for consonants. In noise, envelope expansion improved overall phoneme discrimination by 9.6%, with no difference in benefit between consonants and vowels. The tactile vocoder with envelope expansion can be deployed in real-time on a compact device and could substantially improve clinical outcomes for a new generation of haptic hearing aids.\nPMID:\n38951556\n| PMC:\nPMC11217272\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-65510-6",

Depression is a common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability. Here, We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach using pooled statistics from genome-wide association studies of ISSHL (1491 cases, 196,592 controls) and depression (23,424 cases, 192,220 controls) in European populations. This study investigated the bidirectional relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with depression and ISSHL using inverse variance weighting.Additional sensitivity analyses, such as Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger), weighted median estimates, and leave-one-out analysis, were performed to assess the reliability of the findings. Significant causal association between genetic susceptibility to ISSHL and depression in a random-effects IVW approach (OR = 1.037, 95% CI = 1.004-1.072, P = 0.030). In contrast, genetic depression was not risk factors for ISSHL (OR = 1.134, 95% CI = 0.871-1.475, P = 0.350). After validation by different MR methods and the sensitivity analysis, all of the above results are consistent.

Drawing on principles of sensory substitution, we investigated how interoceptive signals, particularly respiration, could be conveyed through exteroceptive modalities, namely vision and hearing. To this end, we developed a unique, immersive multisensory environment that translates respiratory signals in real-time into dynamic visual and auditory stimuli. The system was evaluated by employing a battery of various psychological assessments, with the findings indicating a significant increase in participants' interoceptive sensibility and an enhancement of the state of flow, signifying immersive and positive engagement with the experience. Furthermore, a correlation between these two variables emerged, revealing a bidirectional enhancement between the state of flow and interoceptive sensibility.

In a prospective, single-blinded study, we utilize pre-operative magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to predict the stiffness of intracranial tumors intraoperatively and assess the impact of increased tumor stiffness on clinical outcomes following microsurgical resection of vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas. MRE measurements significantly correlated with intraoperative tumor stiffness and baseline hearing status of VS patients. Additionally, MRE stiffness was elevated in patients that underwent sub-total tumor resection compared to gross total resection and those with worse postoperative facial nerve function. Furthermore, we identify tumor microenvironment biomarkers of increased stiffness, including αSMA + myogenic fibroblasts, CD163 + macrophages, and HABP (hyaluronic acid binding protein). In a human VS cell line, a dose-dependent upregulation of HAS1-3, enzymes responsible for hyaluronan synthesis, was observed following stimulation with TNFα, a proinflammatory cytokine present in VS. Taken together, MRE is an accurate, non-invasive predictor of tumor stiffness in VS and meningiomas. VS with increased stiffness portends worse preoperative hearing and poorer postoperative outcomes.

Results of audiometry tests, usually represented graphically in the form of an audiogram, need to be interpreted by a professional audiologist in order to determine the exact type of hearing loss and administer proper treatment. However, the small number of professionals in the field can severely delay proper diagnosis. The presented work proposes a neural network solution for classification of tonal audiometry data. The solution, based on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory architecture, has been devised and evaluated for classifying audiometry results into four classes, representing normal hearing, conductive hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and sensorineural hearing loss. The network was trained using 15,046 test results analysed and categorised by professional audiologists. The proposed model achieves 99.33% classification accuracy on datasets outside of training. In clinical application, the model allows general practitioners to independently classify tonal audiometry results for patient referral. In addition, the proposed solution provides audiologists and otolaryngologists with access to an AI decision support system that has the potential to reduce their burden, improve diagnostic accuracy, and minimise human error.\nPMID:\n38902305\n| PMC:\nPMC11190215\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-64310-2",

This cross-sectional study aimed to better characterize these relationships in a large cohort of prelingually deafened children with CIs (N = 47; mean age = 8.33 years) by comprehensively measuring spectral resolution thresholds (measured via spectral modulation detection), temporal resolution thresholds (measured via sinusoidal amplitude modulation detection), and speech recognition (measured via monosyllabic word recognition, vowel recognition, and sentence recognition in noise via both fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and adaptively varied SNR). Results indicated that neither spectral or temporal resolution were significantly correlated with speech recognition in quiet or noise for children with CIs. Both age and CI experience had a moderate effect on spectral resolution, with significant effects for spectral modulation detection at a modulation rate of 0.5 cyc/oct, suggesting spectral resolution may improve with maturation. Thus, it is possible we may see an emerging relationship between spectral resolution and speech perception over time for children with CIs.

A finite element model of the temporal bone with the inner ear, no middle and outer ear structures, and an immobilized stapes footplate was used to assess the directional sensitivity of the cochlea. A concentrated mass represented the bone conduction implant. The harmonic analysis included seventeen frequencies within the hearing range and a full range of excitation directions. Two assessment criteria included: (1) bone vibrations of the round window edge in the direction perpendicular to its surface and (2) the fluid volume displacement of the round window membrane. The direction of maximum bone vibration at the round window edge was perpendicular to the round window. The maximum fluid volume displacement direction was nearly perpendicular to the modiolus axis, almost tangent to the stapes footplate, and inclined slightly to the round window. The direction perpendicular to the stapes footplate resulted in small cochlear responses for both criteria. A key factor responsible for directional sensitivity was the small distance of the excitation point from the cochlea.\nPMID:\n38877090\n| PMC:\nPMC11178818\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-64377-x",

Non-invasive methods to monitor low-grade chronic inflammation may improve the management of older people at risk of poorer outcomes. This longitudinal cohort study has determined baseline inflammation using neopterin volatility in monthly urine samples of 45 independent older adults (aged 65-75 years). Measurement of neopterin, an inflammatory metabolite, enabled stratification of individuals into risk categories based on how often in a 12-month period their neopterin level was raised. Hearing was measured (pure-tone audiometry) at baseline, 1 year and 3 years of the study. Results show that those in the highest risk category (neopterin raised greater than 50% of the time) saw greater deterioration, particularly in high-frequency, hearing. A one-way Welch's ANOVA showed a significant difference between the risk categories for change in high-frequency hearing (W (3, 19.6) = 9.164, p = 0.0005). Despite the study size and duration individuals in the highest risk category were more than twice as likely to have an additional age-related morbidity than those in the lowest risk category. We conclude that volatility of neopterin in urine may enable stratification of those at greatest risk of progression of hearing loss.\nPMID:\n38871776\n| PMC:\nPMC11176182\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-64648-7",

Hearing preservation requires slow insertion, atraumatic electrode and delivery of the optimal quantity of a pharmacological agent. Several studies have reported variable hearing outcomes with osmotic pump-mediated steroid delivery. New drugs, such as sialyllactose (SL) which have anti-inflammatory effect in many body parts, can prevent tissue overgrowth. In the present study, the positive effects of the pharmacological agent SL against insults were evaluated in vitro using HEI-OC1 cells. An animal model to simulate the damage due to electrode insertion during cochlear implantation was used. SL was delivered using osmotic pumps to prevent loss of the residual hearing in this animal model. Hearing deterioration, tissue fibrosis and ossification were confirmed in this animal model. Increased gene expressions of inflammatory cytokines were identified in the cochleae following dummy electrode insertion. Following the administration of SL, insertion led to a decrease in hearing threshold shifts, tissue reactions, and inflammatory markers. These results emphasize the possible role of SL in hearing preservation and improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying hearing loss after cochlear implantation.\nPMID:\n38862572\n| PMC:\nPMC11167013\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-62344-0",

Current single-microphone noise reduction algorithms in hearing aids and CIs only remove predictable, stationary noise, and are ineffective against realistic, non-stationary noise such as multi-talker interference. Recent developments in deep neural network (DNN) algorithms have achieved noteworthy performance in speech enhancement and separation, especially in removing speech noise. However, more work is needed to investigate the potential of DNN algorithms in removing speech noise when tested with listeners fitted with CIs. Here, we implemented two DNN algorithms that are well suited for applications in speech audio processing: (1) recurrent neural network (RNN) and (2) SepFormer. The algorithms were trained with a customized dataset ( ∼ 30 h), and then tested with thirteen CI listeners. Both RNN and SepFormer algorithms significantly improved CI listener's speech intelligibility in noise without compromising the perceived quality of speech overall. These algorithms not only increased the intelligibility in stationary non-speech noise, but also introduced a substantial improvement in non-stationary noise, where conventional signal processing strategies fall short with little benefits. These results show the promise of using DNN algorithms as a solution for listening challenges in multi-talker noise interference.\nPMID:\n38853168\n| PMC:\nPMC11163011\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-63675-8",

SIN performance varies drastically, even among individuals with normal hearing. The present genome-wide association study (GWAS) investigated the genetic basis of SIN deficits in individuals with self-reported normal hearing in quiet situations. GWAS was performed on 279,911 individuals from the UB Biobank cohort, with 58,847 reporting SIN deficits despite reporting normal hearing in quiet. GWAS identified 996 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), achieving significance (p < 5*10\n-8\n) across four genomic loci. 720 SNPs across 21 loci achieved suggestive significance (p < 10\n-6\n). GWAS signals were enriched in brain tissues, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and inferior temporal cortex. Cochlear cell types revealed no significant association with SIN deficits. SIN deficits were associated with various health traits, including neuropsychiatric, sensory, cognitive, metabolic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory conditions. A replication analysis was conducted on 242 healthy young adults. Self-reported speech perception, hearing thresholds (0.25-16 kHz), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (1-16 kHz) were utilized for the replication analysis. 73 SNPs were replicated with a self-reported speech perception measure. 211 SNPs were replicated with at least one and 66 with at least two audiological measures. 12 SNPs near or within MAPT, GRM3, and HLA-DQA1 were replicated for all audiological measures.

These recordings were analyzed to calculate the AVQI and CPPS. The results indicate that CI users' voice quality was detrimentally affected by using their CI, raising to the level of a dysphonic voice. Specifically, when using their CI, mean AVQI scores were 4.0 and mean CPPS values were 11.4 dB, which indicates dysphonia. There were no significant differences in voice quality when comparing participants with bilateral implants to those with one implant.

Nevertheless, research on how voice quality influences listeners' perception, comprehension, and retention of spoken language is limited to a small number of audio-only experiments. We aimed to address this gap by using audio-visual virtual reality (VR) to investigate the impact of a lecturer's hoarseness on university students' heard text recall, listening effort, and listening impression. Fifty participants were immersed in a virtual seminar room, where they engaged in a Dual-Task Paradigm. They listened to narratives presented by a virtual female professor, who spoke in either a typical or hoarse voice. Simultaneously, participants performed a secondary task. Results revealed significantly prolonged secondary-task response times with the hoarse voice compared to the typical voice, indicating increased listening effort. Subjectively, participants rated the hoarse voice as more annoying, effortful to listen to, and impeding for their cognitive performance. No effect of voice quality was found on heard text recall, suggesting that, while hoarseness may compromise certain aspects of spoken language processing, this might not necessarily result in reduced information retention. In summary, our findings underscore the importance of promoting vocal health among lecturers, which may contribute to enhanced listening conditions in learning spaces.\nPMID:\n38811832\n| PMC:\nPMC11137055\n| DOI:\n10.1038/s41598-024-63097-6",
