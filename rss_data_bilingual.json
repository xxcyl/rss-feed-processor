Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: A wide variety of intraoperative tests are available in cochlear implantation. However, no consensus exists on which tests constitute the minimum necessary battery. We assembled an international panel of clinical experts to develop, refine, and vote upon a set of core consensus statements.\nDESIGN: A literature review was used to identify intraoperative tests currently used in the field and draft a set of provisional statements. For statement evaluation and refinement, we used a modified Delphi consensus panel structure. Multiple interactive rounds of voting, evaluation, and feedback were conducted to achieve convergence.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine provisional statements were included in the original draft. In the first voting round, consensus was reached on 15 statements. Of the 14 statements that did not reach consensus, 12 were revised based on feedback provided by the expert practitioners, and 2 were eliminated. In the second voting round, 10 of the 12 revised statements reached a consensus. The two statements which did not achieve consensus were further revised and subjected to a third voting round. However, both statements failed to achieve consensus in the third round. In addition, during the final revision, one more statement was decided to be deleted due to overlap with another modified statement.\nCONCLUSIONS: A final core set of 24 consensus statements was generated, covering wide areas of intraoperative testing during CI surgery. These statements may provide utility as evidence-based guidelines to improve quality and achieve uniformity of surgical practice.\nPMID:\n38915137\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001526",

Children with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing, hearing aid evaluation, or cochlear implant mapping at our tertiary pediatric medical center between January 2018 and December 2021 were included. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify social, demographic, and health factors associated with primary outcomes, defined as age at hearing loss identification, age at intervention (here defined as amplification start), and interval between identification and intervention.\nRESULTS: Of 132 patients included, mean age was 2.4 years, 48% were male, and 51% were Hispanic. There was significant association between each Hispanic ethnicity (p = 0.005, p = 0.04, respectively), insurance type (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively), and later age at identification and intervention. In multivariable analyses, Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with both delays in identification and intervention (p = 0.03 and p = 0.03, respectively), and public insurance was associated with delays in intervention (p = 0.01). In addition, the total number of ABRs was significantly associated with both older age of identification and intervention (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Mediator analysis demonstrated that the effect of ethnicity on age at identification is mediated by the total number of ABRs performed.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant association between total number of ABRs and age at identification and intervention for children with hearing loss exists. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with delays in meeting milestones, further mediated by the number of ABRs, providing a potential avenue for intervention in addressing this disparity.\nPMID:\n38898551\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001534",

This investigation draws on hearing data from 5 to 13 years and again at 45 years of age, to explore the associations between childhood hearing variables and hearing and listening ability at age 45.\nDESIGN: Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between childhood hearing (otological status and mid-frequency pure-tone average) and (a) age 45 peripheral hearing ability (mid-frequency pure-tone average and high-frequency pure-tone average), and (b) age 45 listening ability (listening in spatialized noise and subjective questionnaire on listening experiences). Sex, childhood socioeconomic status, and adult IQ were included in the model as covariates.\nRESULTS: Peripheral hearing and listening abilities at age 45 were consistently associated with childhood hearing acuity at mid-frequencies. Otological status was a moderate predicting factor for high-frequency hearing and utilization of spatial listening cues in adulthood.\nCONCLUSIONS: We aim to use these findings to develop a foundational model of hearing trajectories. This will form the basis for identifying precursors, to be investigated in a subsequent series of analyses, that may protect against or exacerbate hearing-associated cognitive decline in the Dunedin Study cohort as they progress from mid-life to older age.\nPMID:\n38898547\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001542",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: We investigated whether listening effort is dependent on task difficulty for cochlear implant (CI) users when using the Matrix speech-in-noise test. To this end, we measured peak pupil dilation (PPD) at a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNR) by systematically changing the noise level at a constant speech level, and vice versa.\nDESIGN: A group of mostly elderly CI users performed the Dutch/Flemish Matrix test in quiet and in multitalker babble at different SNRs. SNRs were set relative to the speech-recognition threshold (SRT), namely at SRT, and 5 and 10 dB above SRT (0 dB, +5 dB, and +10 dB re SRT). The latter 2 conditions were obtained by either varying speech level (at a fixed noise level of 60 dBA) or by varying noise level (with a fixed speech level). We compared these PPDs with those of a group of typical hearing (TH) listeners. In addition, listening effort was assessed with subjective ratings on a Likert scale.\nRESULTS: PPD for the CI group did not significantly depend on SNR, whereas SNR significantly affected PPDs for TH listeners. Subjective effort ratings depended significantly on SNR for both groups. For CI users, PPDs were significantly larger, and effort was rated higher when speech was varied, and noise was fixed for CI users. By contrast, for TH listeners effort ratings were significantly higher and performance scores lower when noise was varied, and speech was fixed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of a significant effect of varying SNR on PPD suggests that the Matrix test may not be a feasible speech test for measuring listening effort with pupillometric measures for CI users. A rating test appeared more promising in this population, corroborating earlier reports that subjective measures may reflect different dimensions of listening effort than pupil dilation. Establishing the SNR by varying speech or noise level can have subtle, but significant effects on measures of listening effort, and these effects can differ between TH listeners and CI users.\nPMID:\n38886888\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001529",

Online ahead of print.\nABSTRACT\nOBJECTIVES: In clinical and laboratory settings, speech recognition is typically assessed in a way that cannot distinguish accurate auditory perception from misperception that was mentally repaired or inferred from context. Previous work showed that the process of repairing misperceptions elicits greater listening effort, and that this elevated effort lingers well after the sentence is heard. That result suggests that cognitive repair strategies might appear successful when testing a single utterance but fail for everyday continuous conversational speech. The present study tested the hypothesis that the effort of repairing misperceptions has the consequence of carrying over to interfere with perception of later words after the sentence.\nDESIGN: Stimuli were open-set coherent sentences that were presented intact or with a word early in the sentence replaced with noise, forcing the listener to use later context to mentally repair the missing word. Sentences were immediately followed by digit triplets, which served to probe carryover effort from the sentence. Control conditions allowed for the comparison to intact sentences that did not demand mental repair, as well as to listening conditions that removed the need to attend to the post-sentence stimuli, or removed the post-sentence digits altogether. Intelligibility scores for the sentences and digits were accompanied by time-series measurements of pupil dilation to assess cognitive load during the task, as well as subjective rating of effort. Participants included adults with cochlear implants (CIs), as well as an age-matched group and a younger group of listeners with typical hearing for comparison.\nRESULTS: For the CI group, needing to repair a missing word during a sentence resulted in more errors on the digits after the sentence, especially when the repair process did not result in a coherent sensible perception. Sentences that needed repair also contained more errors on the words that were unmasked. All groups showed substantial increase of pupil dilation when sentences required repair, even when the repair was successful. Younger typical hearing listeners showed clear differences in moment-to-moment allocation of effort in the different conditions, while the other groups did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: For CI listeners, the effort of needing to repair misperceptions in a sentence can last long enough to interfere with words that follow the sentence. This pattern could pose a serious problem for regular communication but would go overlooked in typical testing with single utterances, where a listener has a chance to repair misperceptions before responding. Carryover effort was not predictable by basic intelligibility scores, but can be revealed in behavioral data when sentences are followed immediately by extra probe words such as digits.\nPMID:\n38886880\n| DOI:\n10.1097/AUD.0000000000001537",
