                "summary": "Tinnitus, the perception of sound with no external auditory stimulus, is a complex, multifaceted, and potentially devastating disorder. Despite recent advances in our understanding of tinnitus, there are limited options for effective treatment. Tinnitus treatments are made more complicated by the lack of a test for tinnitus based on objectively measured physiological characteristics. Such an objective test would enable a greater understanding of tinnitus mechanisms and may lead to faster..."

In mammals, ITDs are mostly encoded in the medial superior olive (MSO), one of the main nuclei of the superior..."

Impairment of inner ear functions is the main cause of hearing loss. In aged individuals, not only inner ear dysfunction but also senescence of the central nervous system is the cause of malfunction of the auditory system. In most cases of hearing loss, the activity of the auditory nerve is reduced, but that of the successive auditory centers is increased..."

This creates the representation of perceptual objects from sensory features. Oscillatory activity can be differentiated into stimulus-phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced). The former is mainly determined by sensory input, the latter by higher-level (cortical) processing. Effects of auditory deprivation on cortical oscillations have been studied in..."
